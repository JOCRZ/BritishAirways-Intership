0,2023-10-05,,"British Airways was absolutely shocking   Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back.",0.5
1,2023-10-03,,"service was mediocre at best  Just returned from Chicago, flew out 10 days ago on American Airlines absolutely superb in every way, had high expectations on return flight with BA. What a disappointment. The Airbus A380 may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful. Very uncomfortable seats, the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight, the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best. Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early. In future we will travel with one of the American carriers.",0.1
2,2023-10-02,Verified,"BA standards continue to decline   BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided.",0.2
3,2023-10-02,,"won the race to the bottom   Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlines. British Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes. Not looking forward to the flight home.",0.2
4,2023-10-02,Verified,"Not a reliable airline   Not a reliable airline. You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to the gate. The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress. In the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meeting. I thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it's routine for BA not to fly on time.",0.2
5,2023-09-30,Verified,"It is a national disgrace   I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I'm not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curry. Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn't check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being 'bumped' to economy. This airline fails to deliver time and time again. It is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative.",0.3
6,2023-09-30,Verified,"The worst journey in my life   The worst journey in my life. The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost. I filled the form and gave to the employee. I was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference number. BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address. I had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty website. They delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt. I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC. Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BA. Never again!",0.1
7,2023-09-28,Verified,"Very disappointed  The airplanes and the lounges are worn out, old and broken. From Dallas to Heathrow, multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed. The first class seating from Heathrow to Dubrovnik was nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticket. Very disappointed.",0.3
8,2023-09-28,Verified,"the service was shockingly bad  One of the worst experiences on the worst airline. The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues. The time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will not ever use them again.",0.4
9,2023-09-27,Verified,"Never again will I fly BA   Cancelled our flight last-minute then moved us onto a flight 2 days later operated by Japan Airlines. We had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as I am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane. Because it was operated by a different airline but booked by BA, neither BA nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being available. After 4 hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport. I did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online. I got a £10 meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a 14 hour flight. Never again will I fly BA. I would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again.",0.1
10,2023-09-11,Verified,"service on board was impeccable  Despite boarding being the usual free for all at LHR with groups 1-3 being called to board all at once. Whilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate, getting to board before anyone else! However, the service on board was impeccable. Superb crew, friendly, attentive, interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their job. Like BA in the old days and at its best. Food choice and quality seems to have improved too (no beef cheeks thankfully) and even the Club kitchen appears to have returned. Old style Club seating, but is at least better, and feels less cramped, on the 787's.",0.5

14,2023-09-04,Verified,"BA is worse than a low cost carrier   British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now.",0.1
15,2023-09-04,Verified,"less than a premium experience  London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights. The seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on British Airways the Business Class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft. This makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboard. The WiFi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds. But when it worked it was surprisingly fast. Service on this flight was very good and we got to Keflavik on time.",0.1
16,2023-09-04,Verified,"good, but not spectacular  Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777-200. This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I've seen on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn't an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time. In summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product.",0.8
17,2023-09-04,Verified,"Lies and misleading unprofessional service   Care and support shocking. Written by a previously loyal BA traveller. Lies and misleading unprofessional service. Told that my flight was cancelled. Booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy. Called to ask why. Told technical fault with my original flight. My suspicion was another reason. At airport, check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day. Why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place! How can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer.",0.8
18,2023-09-02,Verified,avoid BA like the plague   Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.,0.2
19,2023-09-01,Verified,"British Airways absolutely does not care   British Airways absolutely does not care. My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awful. After enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. No water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier. I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service. My last trip to London was with Delta, they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become.",0.1

21,2023-08-24,Verified,"ravioli pasta had dried out   Ground and cabin crew always provide good customer service. When it comes to catering, Club Class has been reduced to what Economy was. On flight BA621, the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edges. My slice of Camembert was dried- why bother serving it? My bread roll, white olive bread, was dry. I wonder whether anyone in BA monitors that. Club class has become Economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in Club class.  Now it’s a glorified, soulless bus trip, without Britishness.",0.1
22,2023-08-19,Verified,"Great customer service   My family flew from Washington to London on a British Airways A380, we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee. Our flight was unfortunately delayed by 2 hrs from 2245 to 0120 causing us to miss a connection from Gatwick to Turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport. Onboard I sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff. In flight entertainment system didn’t work very well, the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use, it could use updating. The food for dinner was decent, they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards. The seat was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smooth. After we missed our connection and we’re stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts, they rebooked us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the next day, gave us free bus tickets to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room, and gave us Dinner and Breakfast vouchers. Great customer service!",0.4

And then they lose it. I claim it at the arrival airport immediately. Now it's been three weeks, no communication whatsoever, the online status is still “Searching for your bag” with no updates.

Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.,0.1
30,2023-07-21,Verified,"Zero empathy was shown  A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",0.5

There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way.

On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the ""chocolate and orange pot"" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are.

This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience.

Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle..

The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended.",0.9

39,2023-07-09,Verified,"Things have really deteriorated   My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each.

40,2023-06-29,,"preferred to fly on easyJet   Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.",0.5

When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits.

A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy.",0.4

I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either.",0.5

I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints.

66,2023-05-08,Verified,"most appalling airline service   I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out.

The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays.

However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse.

82,2023-03-20,Verified,"how far the quality level has slid   I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them.

The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim.

89,2023-03-15,Verified,"it's by no measure good   
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout.

When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00.

Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee.

However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Do they not check these things? Any help from BA offered - not really.",0.3

My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we've booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service.",0.1

Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed.

Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there.

None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off.

I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle.

Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later).

Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered.

The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight.

The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken.

When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight.

Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last.

They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare.",0.7

Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight.",1.0

I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim's been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. Further to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. The cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. Thanks again for following this up with us. Please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and I hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. Best regards British Airways Customer Relations"".

At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales.

Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co.

Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least.

The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.",0.1
167,2022-06-22,Verified,"BA standards continue to slip   As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip.",0.4

The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”.

The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass!

A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat.

197,2022-04-02,,"you can and need to do better than this   Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case.",0.9

After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos.

Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware.

Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean.

The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley.

This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned.

210,2022-01-25,Verified,"Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard  Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule.

The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying.

213,2022-01-12,,I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday  Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!,0.1
214,2022-01-12,Verified,"return trip was disappointing   Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew",0.3

I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately.

216,2022-01-09,Verified,"complete disregard for your passengers   I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra?

Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor.

Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor.

That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk.

222,2021-12-16,Verified,"certainly make us avoid BA in future   It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind.

226,2021-12-02,Verified,"whole experience was stressful, costly   I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",0.1

My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was.

Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers.

You should have a button saying “Change name”. Anyways not the point. The woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do.

The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed.

BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far.

However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service.

I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked.

I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route.

I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in",1.0
264,2020-12-09,Verified,"passengers with masks below nose   Dubai to London on 5th December. Flight was ok - seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross.  Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other. Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all. When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose. Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them. Of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks, enforced by the airlines.",1.0

I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled.

I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight.

If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced.

I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy.

Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.",0.5

Professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.",0.1

Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later. Conclusion, never fly BA again.",0.8

My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together.

The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I’ve flown.

I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when I fly. I told him I could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job.

Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served.

However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service ""business class""? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent.

329,2019-12-04,Verified,"the shortage of staff   The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.",0.1

I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only.

I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking.",0.9
354,2019-10-09,Verified,"the experience was outstanding  Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new ""business suite"" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don't know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.",0.2

When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so.

360,2019-09-27,,"I never received the refund   I did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28. I never received the refund.",0.5
361,2019-09-26,Verified,"not too bad, all in all  The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all.",0.1

During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm.

364,2019-09-21,Verified,"the value was very good  Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",0.9

Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off!

The aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made. The standards on BA have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame. I hope management are looking at reviews such as this, to improve service.",0.5

The entertainment system was great with a good selection. It makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (Etihad, why don’t you do this?). The cabin crew were good. Economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many. Good value flight, especially as the only other carrier to Abu Dhabi is Etihad.",0.2

I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. Paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. Reasonable price and speed.",0.2
374,2019-09-04,,"buyer beware   London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.",0.4

Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany.

Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.",0.1
398,2019-07-28,Verified,"seat comfort has been sacrificed   Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.",0.8

Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable.

418,2019-06-07,Verified,"I might fly them again   Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",0.3

420,2019-05-28,Verified,couple of very good flights   London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.,0.5
421,2019-05-28,Verified,"service on this flight was superb   The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.",0.9

The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.",0.9

There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts.

427,2019-05-23,Verified,"expected a better level of attention to detail  I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight.

Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor.",0.3

The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist.

The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair.

Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful.",0.6

If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.

When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly.",0.2

Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty.

Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points.

447,2019-04-11,Verified,"both involuntarily downgraded   St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it.

450,2019-03-18,Verified,"Effectively a budget airline   Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory.",0.5

Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me.",0.2

BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone.

Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public.

479,2019-01-30,Verified,"it's showing its age  
The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. Cabin crew were generally good and the CSM was particularly visible during the flight. Breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. Arrival was ahead of schedule.",0.6

The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea.

Within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert. Wine selection was very American with jug wines. The movie selection was OK. The PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference. The 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies.",0.7

At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg.

490,2018-12-30,Verified,"the cabin was modern and clean  I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic.

491,2018-12-29,,"most uncomfortable plane   Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.",0.8

493,2018-12-24,Verified,"a total disappointment   Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast. That flight was a total disappointment.",0.1

I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time.

497,2018-12-22,Verified,"so much BA could do to improve   Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.",0.1

Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it.

The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting.

Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking?

The check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. Boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tedious. Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA. Well done to the superb crew!",0.9
519,2018-10-25,Verified,"I was disappointed   London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option. They need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers.",0.9
520,2018-10-15,Verified,"BA club world is a farce   London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic. Never again, BA club world offered is a farce in today's business market.",0.5
521,2018-10-13,Verified,"BA lacks consistency   Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills.

523,2018-10-06,,"5 mins too late for me to check in   Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways. Like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support.",0.1
524,2018-10-01,Verified,"aircraft interior was old   London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice.",0.1

We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather nice. The Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. A very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. Coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm Ali. We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side.

My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it.

Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BA's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere.

The Club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least ten, fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children.

The Iberia lounge at Madrid is equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast. British Airways is a rip off. I have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their A321 and seat 22c. This seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others.

However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may this improvement last!",0.5

Did not want to pay the usual BA extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. Of course the usual BA Club Class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World. Welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FA. OK meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. Much more up to date touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA's - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. As usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat.

545,2018-08-12,Verified," a very acceptable flight  This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.",0.7

Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.",0.7

We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case BA were lacking.",0.1

We travelled on the first Saturday of the school holidays and whilst Gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad. We expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats. The flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glass. The meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the main course, which was tasty and not dried out. Flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Very happy with the service.",0.5

New York to Nairobi via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. The IFE on the LHR-NBO leg reminds me of the game ""pong"" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. BA charges to select Business Class seats. For my family of 4, it would have cost over $1,600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 segments.",0.8

I was fortunate to travel Hong Kong to London return in Premium Economy recently. Being able to check-in at the downtown Hong Kong Airport Express station is a real bonus as is using the good Qantas Lounge at Hong Kong. I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. The new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates. Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. I also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'Goswami' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at Heathrow. All-in -all made for an enjoyable experience, a rarity these days.",0.1
553,2018-07-22,Verified,"food and drink was pretty good   Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it. Priority disembarkation and baggage at Gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly.",0.8

Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.",0.7

The service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated. The return flight was a disaster. The seats were dirty, food was like rubber, plane was dated, seats smelt, Lauren Perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason, some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great. When I complained I was offered 8,000 Avios, are you serious BA? I think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that I experienced on British Airways. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly with another airline.

We arrived in Miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning. By the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab. Our flights home to Dublin via Heathrow were fine until we reached Dublin and realised they had lost our bag. Despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day (it was put on the wrong plane - again no apologies given for this inconvenience).

Failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. Advised stewardess but they did not care.

She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films.

The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight.

Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. It is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlines. As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off. Those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic, but the crew handled the situation admirably. They more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking.",0.6
568,2018-06-25,Verified,"seat was below my expectation  When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with British Airways staff. Right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. She spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late. Because I need special assistance they didn't have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it. My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines. The food was just OK nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice.

Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA.

All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund.

It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. They have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors, no results. There is no one to solve problems.

There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule.

Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy.

Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again.

579,2018-06-06,Verified,"budget airlines can do better   Our original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. I consider this to be completely unacceptable. If this is the level of service we can now expect from British Airways, there is no point traveling with them. The budget airlines can do better at lower cost.",0.8

At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). Raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. Separate complaint raised to CAA about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat. Conclusion is families avoid at all costs.",0.5

I paid around £150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said she'd take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded.

585,2018-05-27,Verified,"this experience was a disgrace   Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade. BA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again.",0.1
586,2018-05-26,Verified,"IFE is a work of mystery  Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",0.2
587,2018-05-25,Verified,"years have not been kind  Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002. The years have not been kind to BA. Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlines. Nearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the A380 but that is well known. Very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking. Check in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. No menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC offers a better grade of plastic. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and Coke. This is available on Qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. Final word about this leg is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. One or two interesting things and some new releases. Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not all into Brit Pop and edgy music presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that BA set many years ago.",0.4

On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey.

The seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough.

597,2018-05-03,Verified,"experience was totally acceptable   Los Angeles to London Heathrow return.  Outbound First Class, return Club World. A380 both sectors, awesome aircraft. Firstly, BA flight deck crews are awesome. Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. Their service was excellent. I wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn’t eat anything, so I can’t comment on the food. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I was in 53K which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their 777-300s. BA business class is really dated, and I said it felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. I was pulled aside for screening 3 times. I don’t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive. I am enrolled in and pay for TSA Pre Check and if British Airways would participate in this program, it would save a lot of angst.

It is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. I cannot fly during the day as I have meetings scheduled. BA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. Moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that BA is offering during the day. They also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or club Europe) is less important as Saturday not a working day and one can get a rest.

The personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen, so I had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I saw some passengers request for more food, and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. Whilst AA is improving, BA is becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. The seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 star.

Also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system.

Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge.

I am a Qantas frequent flyer and so I ought to have had the chance to check-in a few days ahead of the flight. The BA website would not let me do so. The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. Disembarkation was slow and badly managed. Nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers.

609,2018-04-12,Verified,"Not value for money  I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. Thumbs down to BA.",0.4

Check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. I managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.",0.7

Once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not working. The cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. There was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. As it was a night flight, my wife and I had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. Any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. As BAs safety demonstration prior to take off is on video, we didn't receive this. The flight was the worst airline experience we've had. I doubt I'll ever fly with BA again.",0.7

The plane was not very clean, grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats. The staff were pleasant. Breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate. The return was poorly organised, no use of fast track security for business class passengers. Long queue for boarding and a grubby plane. Really no point in paying for business class. The staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment, dog-eared magazines.  Quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration.",0.1
614,2018-03-30,Verified,"extremely unprofessional  London to Casablanca. Their customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchy. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. TAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flight. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. They were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of BA. This is very rude and extremely unprofessional. I've never had this treatment during my 10+ years of flying with various airlines, both top rated and low cost carrier.",0.4

616,2018-03-28,Verified,regret choosing BA  Hyderabad to Brussels via London. Didn't expect this from British Airways. For me quality hit the rock bottom. Especially the unclean flight. I would have preferred the aircraft from Brussels to London and vice versa for the long haul travel. Maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price I paid for ticket I think it's not worth it. Other airline which I used to travel had the same price and if I compare the services of that ariline I regret choosing British Airways.,0.8
617,2018-03-24,Verified,"an entirely reasonable flight  London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is one of BA's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. From September 2018, the Gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced Club World. The 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard 90s vintage, which meant 48 pax squeezed into the Club World cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient, small screen, low resolution IFE that required the usual rebooting. But there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved Club World food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at Fort Lauderdale terminal 4. Overall, an entirely reasonable flight.",0.2

As a frequent flyer I haven’t felt the needed to complain nor commend until now. I had to say something, to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights I have ever had. This is old school airline service, puts the glamour and luxury back into air travel. Cabin staff made me feel like I was the only person they were serving.

Obviously, since then it was not refurbished. Felt like a teenager again. Worn seats, cracks in the walls and dirty. Additonally, the IFE did not work. At the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment. As the night approached, crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. No IFE and no book reading possible. Crew were young and friendly, but obviously not experienced. Took 2.5 hours until we had our meal after take-off - they skipped our last four rows. Only after inquiring we got a tray. On arrival, new contractor at Terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available. Needed to wait 20 minutes until someone arrived. Overall, poor experience with British Airways. They used to be good, but they try to be low-cost and charge legacy carrier prices. Will not work. To fly, to serve is no more adequate as their slogan.",0.5
621,2018-03-11,Verified,"service attentive and prompt  Warsaw to London. WAW is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control “Bolero” is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport. BA have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly. Seat in club Europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch - frankly it’s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats. The service was very good, attentive and prompt. The food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert and cheese course with drinks flowing, frankly well above expected.",0.3

The crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers, but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there. They should smile and be a little more considerate.

627,2018-03-01,Verified,my worst experience in business class  I flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hong Kong in Club World on a A380. They have recently introduced the new Club World service on this route and it was a complete disaster. It took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight. They ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold. The cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn’t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. Overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA concept doesn’t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight). I am gold on BA and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future.,0.6

Off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the door, huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago. The lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. Our return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest.

The old 777s they use out of Gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. The TV screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is OK. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. As always with BA the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly, others were borderline rude. However I would probably still choose BA to Cape Town in order to fly direct.",0.5

They both smelt revolting and I didn't even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldn't eat anymore. Chicken curry was questionable or again Spinach Lasagne - just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesn't mean they what spinach with every meal, there are some very nice alternatives out there.

It was mainly just rice. The biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten. I commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising. Come on guys - even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel? What planet are you on?,0.8

I literally had to run to find my way through Heathrow to to board my connection. As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. My only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very late. It was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. That kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. Toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. However, I wasn't impressed by the seats in BA flights. I found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia). I also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough. The AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia had Bose noise canceling headphones, while the BA flights had just regular ones. No big deal, but still.",1.0
637,2018-02-06,Verified,first and last journey  San Francisco to Hyderabad via London. I had a really bad experience with British Airways. I had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try British Airways instead of taking my regular Emirates. The flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. The customer care was unresponsive. I have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. I had to go book Emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in price. I wrote email to customer care. It has taken so much time to get a response from them. The bad part is they won’t refund your ticket price. I hope no one goes through such similar issue. My honest opinion: Be sure of your travel plans before you book British Airways. I was my first and last journey. I wont recommend personally to anyone.,0.7

On this occasion, I had invested in an upgrade and as such I expected nothing less. For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their offer of compensation was £200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future. Their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values: “Meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming British Airways into the world's leading global premium airline. Our investment in our staff, our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service.” The experience with BA has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday!

Why pay more to fly business then? Dreadful! Flew in from Chicago to Heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest I’ve ever seen and with awful food. The controls in my first class seat did not work either. British Airways is fast going down the drains. Avoid!,0.5

A lot of back and forth, but the bottom line, BA could not get me back to YVR until Thursday. I could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-book. Or they could fly me into Seattle on Tuesday and I must make my way home from there on my own dime, and I could submit for reimbursement from BA - no guarantees they will reimburse though. I was told when BA cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs there and at home.

We tried to check in on line and were unable to. When we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to Costa Rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airport. This flight had been booked since March 2017 and no one had raised this The assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage.

When I asked, please may I have some snacks, I was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation.

I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA.

Glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. Cabin crew came by constantly to see how I was doing on both legs. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. The seat itself was not as wide as I anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. The 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. Comfortable and quiet. Fast track passes an added plus. Flying out of San Jose is a bonus since I'm a ten minute drive to home.

Flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. No assistance provided by BA. Told it wasn't there problem and sort my own accommodation out.

Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for.

653,2018-01-01,Verified,"I was sorely disappointed  I flew Premium Economy from London to Cape Town on British Airways. Having flown Premium Economy before, I had certain expectations of what I would be getting, but I was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive Premium Economy I have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worst. The plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. From Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where I was constantly pushing against it. I finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. The personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones - the screen was tiny, the blind next to me could not be pulled down. The headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that I spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in, so that I could actually hear anything. Expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. I find it shocking that BA charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. I needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times, with no success, I phoned BA and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which I gave up and just cancelled the flight, which worked first time. I booked a flight on another airline and for just £200 more, I got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant.",0.1

It seems that BA is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as European destinations are concerned.

665,2017-12-03,Verified,"the worst travel experience   Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage.  They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",0.1

Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. It looks a bit better. Had a snack and a few glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal B. Friendly FA showed me and wife to our seats. Looked freshly cleaned. Pushed back on time. 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was nice. Some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. Cheese and biscuits to conclude. Wines were ok. The seat (the new ""First"") - is not wearing well. Looking somewhat tired. Managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. I am a tall guy and need the space. the Club World option is horrendous. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. Readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. If Mr Cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. The flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. The 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort of an upmarket Business class"". I'd agree with that. One would think, BA would want to make a big impression on this route - with at least some high end food.

This flight was again full and had been for weeks. 14 people. 3 beefs. A joke. My wife had an Arab dish which she did not like. When it came to coffee, my friend, then I - had a choice of chocolates. My wife then had the box offered - only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy FA. Most BA cabin staff are good - this one was a PR disaster. Flight was smooth all the way home.

671,2017-11-24,Verified,"BA is shameless and embarrassing   London Heathrow to Basel. Boarding: There are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (The new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further.) Since I was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, I found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. Yes, BA appears intent on replicating England's class system!  On board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a French ATC strike. Obviously, this was not BA's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. After take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. Why BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. The no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. The trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. End of service. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the premium seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. It wasn't until I had left the airport that I was able to get that cup of tea. Needless to say, Eurowings and EasyJet do things much better.",0.3

Impossible to hear information from the flight deck. These ageing 747’s really are in desperate need of replacement. The congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. The minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired.

PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier.

The extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only?

Talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight.

675,2017-11-21,Verified,"the CEO is running BA to the ground   Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. It is clear to me the CEO is running BA to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .",0.9

We passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. I had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. At such an unsociable hour of the morning, I could no longer disturb her. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. On arrival, I was brusquely told by a BA rep to go online and find my own accommodation. After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. I was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where I should have been. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working). Also had I known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. Further wait. Not only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination.

678,2017-11-20,Verified,"solid product and excellent crew   Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel.

679,2017-11-20,Verified,"was a very enjoyable flight   London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet.

680,2017-11-15,Verified,"Cost cutting was in evidence   London to Bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates, Etihad which are far more superior. The plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing. On this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff. Cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get, the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone. It's more akin to economy, also a real negative point is your at Heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses! A shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport. This flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit. Plane was delayed 45 mins & arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either. IFE was poor with old films that they call new releases, no where near on a par with Qatar Airways.",0.5
681,2017-11-14,Verified,"crew amazingly helpful   London to Philadelphia. Ticket booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £2.5k in business class return so very good value. Positives - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFE. Cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful. T5 Lounge fine, flight on time. Bags off very quickly. Negatives - food on on both legs wasn't great. Salad poor and main beef meal very average. Pudding which is normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. The real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't have to as they were done for the day. BA are getting so much stick at the moment - their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of £15k. The crew lift this product to a much higher level.",0.5
682,2017-11-13,Verified,"extra cost not justified   British Airways short haul Business Class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. So is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges). Priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. Having maneuvered into the cramped seat, I was offered a hot towel as soon as I sat down. I couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. It was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. But I guess it was something different BA was trying out. The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. Soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. The service was good, considering a one hour flight. Despite a Boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. To me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. How can this be branded as Business Class? Is the extra cost justified to fly Club Europe? Absolutely not.",0.8
683,2017-11-13,Verified,"requested Asian vegetarian food   I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled.  I was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. When I reached Phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in, then down to go through security again to board my flight. On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage, so please keep it unlocked.  I requested Asian vegetarian food but when I got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet. When I mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said that’s what you asked for but I said sorry I didn’t as on the food label clearly says 18A and my seat no is 18K so how is this my food. She still didn’t believe me instead of apology she said I have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you.

I have a connexion at JFK and I showed her the boarding passes but she wouldn't interline my bag to their partner AA and I had to recheck it.

685,2017-11-11,Verified,"need to clean the planes more often   London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",0.2

Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket.

Actually, British Airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain, and called this a business class! Moreover, our pre-flight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because British Airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in Victoria Falls. Yes, during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks, but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets $1,372 rather than $703, which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets?",0.3
688,2017-11-10,Verified,"disappointed with the return flight   London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc. - The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. - Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen, then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. This was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was  faulty. The usual 'push and release' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen, it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would  open, this happened during take off and landing, as well as throughout the flight.  For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class. We have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our American Express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher, for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. Whilst the outbound flight was great, I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. The hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact, the situation got worse. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re-set; after that, the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. As you can imagine, it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it. It was impossible to turn the screen off completely.",0.1

They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to South Africa. There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking.

The boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean. My seat was comfortable for a short flight. The captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew I could see worked very hard and were pleasant. The crew made use of Italian and were cheerful and professional.

I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ). Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed on October 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160. We were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers.

694,2017-10-27,Verified,"gripe is about the current food service   Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London.

Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days.

One can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time.

703,2017-10-17,Verified,"depths to which BA have descended   Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight.  We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. We are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. You almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. We should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. The return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAP. The service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. My wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas I at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. The entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows its age. This flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. BA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. It will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. We will probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club World) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!",0.1
704,2017-10-17,Verified,"I won't fly with them again   London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied ""can I check - you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window"". I replied yes. After a series of phone calls, the upgrade was processed (I paid 149 GBP). My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasn't for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith.

705,2017-10-15,Verified,"Overall a good flight   Gatwick to Faro. Pretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good value. Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while. Priority baggage didn’t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags. Overall a good flight.",0.2

Cabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. Everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. Staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy.

It's a joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeks. They only responded when I chased them up, said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. Can you believe that?

Upon returning to GCM from LON on October 6, 2017, I had to pay £290 for additional baggage.  Particularly for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good education.  In addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights?

British Airways used to be my favourite airline, however, over the last 2 years I have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights I have had with them. I do fly with BA about 30 times a year. In this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities) I was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind I was flying at 7am the morning after. Their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight. I must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy. When I managed to connect I have had to hold for an hour before the line died. I have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. Horrible customer service by the way, the person I was talking to couldn't care less. I was originally flying in business and I was placed in economy instead. I was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions (a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries) and promised a refund on the fare which to date (about 4 months later) has still not happened. If you call them they transfer your call to India where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help.

Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these.

I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. I had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. I told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look into. In-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lot. I had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat, who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat, sometimes talked louder than necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers. There were minor issues during check-in at the departure airport in Port of Spain, the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as I have a gold card on Oneworld. To use the lounge I had to use my Priority Pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff. I was flying further from Gatwick to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, hoping I would not have to change airports in London and as a result go through immigration, take the baggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn't have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process.",0.3

British Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselves. For them to call it ""First Class"" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extreme.

I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). I still don’t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew’s fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal.

Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price.

722,2017-09-11,Verified,"they are just an embarrassment   London Gatwick to Funchal. In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. They have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. And that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. On our flights to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that's in the next part of the BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.",0.9

Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight.

Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late.

The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok. We had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep. He was drenched and I had no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn't be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight.

The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while. This is a great shame for a good looking cabin. We took off twenty minutes after the intended time, due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time.

A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up.

They seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us, and that is just not acceptable. Sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness. BA management should be fired, or at least the CEO, Mr Cruz, who is destroying our national airline. I'm not a grumpy old man, just a customer with over 50 years experience of flying British Airways (and BOAC and BEA), and a direct witness to the demise of what was a great airline.",0.2

Woken at 7am by text to say 13.30 flight to Heathrow cancelled for operational reasons - phone numbers listed to rearrange. One not open till 9am GMT, the Greek one no longer in use. Website also useless: 'We are experiencing technical difficulties - try again later.' 2 stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights - but downgraded on both sectors. [Still not happy that I was involuntarily downgraded on my last BA flight at Easter!] Athens used to have a great BA lounge. Now it's provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grim. Partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight. Flights adequate but no different really to service of any budget airline. Crew apologetic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in BA's direction. Athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people - albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain / claim. BA are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew - without them I'd have already deserted. Still waiting for any response from airline re EU compensation / downgrade almost 2 weeks after submitting forms / emails. This could surely be automatic [managed by most US airlines] and contrasts with a recent Air France experience of far more trivial nature where within 24 hours I'd received a voucher and a personal apology.",0.1
740,2017-08-07,Verified,"they are now a junk airline   Nice to London Heathrow. I had to fly to Nice and back for work. Booked through the Company travel Agency. Extra bag added both ways. I wanted to fly back to LHR earlier so my Travel Agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 GBP. When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flight. I stood my ground, but the Head of Check in told me if I wanted to fly I had to pay 75 EUR which I did under duress. I had prebooked my seat as Silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  The trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means I will not be choosing this airline again. I have one more flight with them next week and that's it. I paid almost 1100 pounds to get to Nice and back today, in economy, I was greeted with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite the high prices, have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic.

Perfunctory service at best! Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. My understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 stars. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offer more beverages. And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. The wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet. On Westjet, you purchase your food, but I'm sure it has to be superior to BA's offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Air France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only redeeming factor on this flight was the Airbus 380, still the smoothest and quietest plane flying! Apparently British Airways CEO is an accountant and the 'bean counting' shows in the service and food quality offered!

How times have changed! Under recent CEOs, most notably the current holder the post, Alex Cruz, BA has declined to the level of a budget airline. In fact, I've had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. Flying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it's a wonderful aircraft. Beyond that - atrocious. Dinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. Hardly suitable breakfast fare. The entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. No snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every way.

It was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we'll just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices.

It took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 (our row) there was no food left not even a Kit-Kat we had the last can of Coca Cola and a bottle of water. Several factors contributed to this silly situation : BA Trying to become a low cost airline (I did not realise that it had sunk so low when I booked). The fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay.  The blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling.

Problems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. From various conversations that took place, it would appear that there were no British Airways staff at Venice Marco Polo airport; everything is handled by the local service agents. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties.  Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge, the departure board information did not help. After arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away, arriving at 24:00.

As a BA Gold member I used the First class wing at T5, this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. We were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. The lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. The buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilli. My wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was bland. The drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although I don't drink the stuff the choice looked extensive. I had a few glasses of Henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful Castlenau they used to have but not as good as the Taittinger they served a year ago. I tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can't remember what it was called but it was very nice. Finally I couldn't resist a shot of Johnnie Walker Blue. The first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. I normally try to fly another Oneworld airline other than BA. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA Gatwick First lounge than the Galleries T5. The flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on time. I didn't bother with the BoB as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in Bologna. Cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the BoB offering. We sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3L. Really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight. Due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the last passengers to exit. It was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage. Despite a lot of moans about BA on this forum I can't really complain about the overall experience. As a Gold member the lounge access was free.

The good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful.

Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win.

This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats.

It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. By the time it arrived all that was available was a KitKat and some other sweets! They had already run out of sandwiches / hot food. It took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card - and the machine seemed to keep on having problems.

BA Economy is on a par with Ryanair. Business is okay. Economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food. Regardless of class of travel, the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition. The following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller. I started watching a movie on the flight from Montreal to London but the last 15 min of the movie were missing. It looked like the recording consisted of only the first 105 min (out of 121 min total) of the movie. In the next few days I tried to see the last part of the movie on other two BA flights (business and economy plus) and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing. In addition to this minor problem, all BA flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system: the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise (once again, the same problem applied to all flights).",0.5

For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. The food was also poor. No snacks offered, and the meals were slop. I have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comfort.

768,2017-07-05,Verified,"recommend to avoid flying with BA   London to Hong Kong in premium economy. I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. I will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA.",0.2

So, another 20 minutes later, I spoke to another (very caring and helpful) BA agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost +£500 onto my £218 ticket! I could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less! I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help. BA - you are in serious need of a makeover and self-examination to have customers, such as I, consider using you again and not tell everyone to avoid you and write reviews such as this.",0.2

Chose seats 1E and 1F on both legs for my partner and I, and seats were clean, well maintained, fully functioning and very comfortable. Ground service at T5 is a vast improvement with the new First Wing; passed through quickly and met by attentive staff, with prompt and professional service in the Concorde Room. Golden Lounge at Kuala Lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu. Onboard the staff on both legs were professional, friendly, intuitive, attentive and good natured, and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests. Flowers in the bathroom (which was kept clean, though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times) and amuse bouche provided. Plenty of wine, no shortage of food and nothing ran out - my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask.

772,2017-06-30,Verified,"Club World is now very tired and worn  British Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported ""The most delay-afflicted route. 85 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer"". As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delays. Indeed my flight the delay was, as usual, over an hour. The Club World product is now very tired and worn - no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers. The BA crew were fine, but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. Usual chaotic boarding process for this flight - the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage, but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. It will never work on this routing. When will BA learn? The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, American or Royal Jordanian. The constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service. The comfort is now more akin to Ethiopian Airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of BA. The LHR-ACC-LHR route is a money maker for BA - they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth. Air France and KLM probably offer a better business class service on this route. A great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard.",0.2

On this occasion I have decided to drive down to London Heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike! I telephoned BA customer service today to ask about the laptop situation, after pressing many buttons I was informed all the lines are busy and cut off.

If British airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally. We were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase. All we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits. This flight left around lunchtime and I would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. To add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. It was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting.  'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore. Easy jet, Ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles. I cannot imagine flying with BA again.",0.1

Yes, they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. Once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet. No welcome. The seats were hard and uncomfortable. Before taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door. The door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty. A strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying! When the food service came I was asleep but my said they ignored her.

After take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably I had to pay £2.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided.

777,2017-06-27,Verified,"BA are going backwards   Chennai to London. What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timing. But I have nothing good to say about the whole thing. The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. Once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and if you're in the Aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by Boeing. It was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter of BA and I'm so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customer. Sorry BA but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money, because it won't last, people like me will move on.",0.1
778,2017-06-27,Verified,"Leg room was atrocious   Flew London Gatwick to Genoa with British Airways. Fast check in at the smart new premium area at Gatwick. Brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food, drink and magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal I realize that nothing can be done about that. The gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace, especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators. On board our Club Europe seats that we had paid extra to choose, something that no other airline that I know of does with a full Business Class fare, was behind the curtain. Overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club Europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance. An engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3. My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. Given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport. In all this was not a Business Class quality flight, we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price.",0.3
779,2017-06-27,Verified,"now providing a very inferior product   
Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely. Shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels.",0.4
780,2017-06-19,Verified,"whether I continue my loyalty   This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed Fleet"". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken curry was served but I still don't see it as Biz class food. A choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. The jury remains out on whether I continue my loyalty to BA and One World - it really depends on what BA do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - I'm off).",0.5

782,2017-06-17,Verified,"crews very young, unprofessional  The crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from Johannesburg to London were very young, unprofessional, and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the British Airways crews special and outstanding. They were basically (on both flights) rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service. On both flights, there was no water offered during the night, which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium. The meals were overcooked, and on both flights the knives could not cut through the ""best of British Beef"". Given that the hot meals are the same than in Club (according to BA's marketing), I would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in Business Class. A perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when I got up after dinner and went to the galley (as nobody cared to answer the bell) and asked for a Baileys: the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a Baileys was, and the answer came ""sorry Sir, we don't have that kind of wine. Would you like some white?"" I am missing the good old BA and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future, even if it means paying a few hundreds more.",0.1

Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. Boarding was a disaster, we were called to board but then waited on the air-bridge for over 20 minutes. The air-bridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no AC or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out. Eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy). There was no communication from the ground staff, which although not BA staff reflects badly on the airline. Once we were finally on-board the flight was trouble free. Good service. Hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant.

Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future. Bye BA.",0.5

There were seats with missing backs and 'Do Not Occupy' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley, and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering, and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button.

BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think that's a poor ratio. The flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. The beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recently.

The catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any).

No bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore. Dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option. The chicken breast I received was laughable. I have seen bigger chicken nuggets. This came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. The only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule scone. My advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry. Staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley.

We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them. We used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was good. On the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn't fancy the Marks and Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our gate, and thought that was expensive enough, but the BA on board water was £1.80 per bottle. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. On our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure. At all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up.

After getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend IT fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by BA, I approached my flight back to the UK with some trepidation. My fears were not unfounded. As the aircraft had been sitting at JNB for most of the day, there were no delays and boarding started very early. I was seat 83A (top deck, double seat) and the leg room was no better than you would find on a Ryanair flight to Dublin. Indeed, due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat, it was a little more cramped. The service on BA flights really is terrible. I, along with many other passengers, was treated like an inconvenience and I felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren't there. I was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff. I will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future.",0.3

The cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabin. Smooth connections at Terminal 5 with no waiting (either way) and Tribute Cornish Ale available on the long haul drinks menu, and service is a winner.

I had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem, however I was duly downgraded to Silver. I then booked a holiday in Rome for my wife and myself and I was amazed that BA have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea ! If BA wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine. They have in the past left me stranded in Moscow for 5 days when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow, I have encountered rude staff on check in, long queues even for Executive members. They are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status, I will in future fly Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa or Internal UK Easyjet. They are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let get poor reviews.

No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There's really no comparison to Emirates' long-haul offering in Business.",0.2

I was always of the belief that British Airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but I realise now that they are no better than budget airlines. In fact I have experienced far better service on EasyJet. We waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and I ordered Marks & Spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours. On top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. Of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took! They make it very clear that 'economy' class is just that but its shame the price doesn't match the standard of service. All in all a very disappointing experience and I will certainly think twice about choosing BA in future.,0.2

One crew was rude and when asked could I have a glass of water told me that it would take a long time and he disapeared down the back to chat to his fellow workers.  The food was slapped up and we were not offered another drink. All male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the back and ignored when called.

I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent. These days I would choose AA (or Delta, United, Virgin) any day over BA. It was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience.",0.9

Made time for a good rest. Configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats. Some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5.

Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the B787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any B777 I've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the ""cocoon"" look less cramped). Even the seat looks wider, while the IFE screen is wider with a higher resolution. The odd ""ying-yang"" layout is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won't share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes though. The crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. Overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth EUR3,000 spent. Still no wi-fi on BA. Not commenting the ying-yang layout, which remains a mystery to me (who approved such a nonsense?).",0.6

The check-in was smooth which encouraged me that I had made the right choice. However on-board the ageing Boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about, the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than I have previously had with BA. The space available was tight for me; an average sized man - I don't know how a larger and or taller person would manage.

It turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seat. I would have preferred a window-seat though.

She said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best. After less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom. So I stayed. The rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too. Special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism. I brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering-service was slow. The new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly. BA should reinstall the old system again.

Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and plenty of booze. Nice and airy with spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. All good so far.

Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Plane old and dirty. The WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect. Took off on time. My wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tasteless. I settled for a couple of Gin and Tonics.

A tiny beetroot salad. The obligatory hard as rock bread roll. For dessert, a small piece of chocolate brownie.Complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didn't realise they could ask for wine etc. A small container of water was on the tray.This meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. At which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box, a packet of crisp and popcorn (all carbohydrates) and a small container of water. I tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.Then tea/coffee was served.  I am not expecting a gourmet meal, but there was no thought given to the food provided on British Airways. There was no fruit, no salad, or proper vegetables. There were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. The flight entertainment did not exist. A couple of new films, the rest were old or unheard of. The music/radio (audio) was the same with no new music or unheard of artists. My daughter, booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the US. I have asked her not to book me on British Airways again. I would rather travel on Virgin or Delta indirect. This by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly I just couldn't wait to get off.",0.3

Of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked J and K seats. Check in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn't even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn't it fixed prior to the flight?). For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet! Not good enough. Food and wine were OK and crew were good. Flat bed was good.

Terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. We secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. Seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. BA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgement. Once we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn't expect any either, they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. We got more food and snacks on our Qantas flight from Singapore to Australia, which was much shorter at 7 hours. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, as I prepared myself for the worst. I would only fly them again if I can score cheap seats.",0.7

It's not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakes. The small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc. have gone too. And I'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6 weeks ahead. It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore. The last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedible. Just about to book with another airline on principle. I have to say I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave.

836,2017-04-24,Verified,"told snacks had been withdrawn   Bangkok to London Heathrow. Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. The flight was packed full. The inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. I have noticed that BA don't seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009 flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. I managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. I have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry with little humidity. I do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestion. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. I complained to BA and also emailed CEO Alex Cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. I was advised that the lack of IFE would be investigated by their maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn't expect them to. By way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. The only way to check is to fly that route again with BA, do I risk it ? Therefore I will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change!",0.2

My disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins.

Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was ok, nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name. Friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. Flew the same route with Qatar Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. I am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit, like most people.

In other words, they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage. Now you pay for food and even water. Two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. How can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. It is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service - a shame to be called British.

The trip took place on April 3rd 2017 We risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at LHR, because of AA somehow ""magically"" losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping, rather blaming everyone else. The BA service personnel spent hours trying to solve it, and  decided to take matters in their own hands. They got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from LHR to LAS the day after, arranging for accommodation, transport to/from the airport and Dinner / Breakfast, even though AA was mainly responsible for our journey. The service on-board was to expect from a economy flight of that duration. Seats was good, food all right, complimentary drinks and very welcome.

The food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and there were only two for a fully booked economy class). On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that I literally could not even cross my legs, as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. Seats were not reclining either.

There is no food, nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail's pace with a trolley.

The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you.

They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late.

The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew.

The main meal we were served was absolutely awful. It was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just like gunge, and was not edible. I really don't know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. Also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed - which seemed totally unnecessary. As I was hungry between courses I went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor, and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason. I have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years. I have been a BA silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew.

What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usual. The only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre.

I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to.

Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. Sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. You're promising things you can't deliver, BA. There is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. Whoever at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways is almost complete. You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""British Airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",0.1
858,2017-04-06,Verified,"can no longer live on past reputation  Having only flown easyJet / Ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, I was pleased to see a relatively low-cost BA flight for my round trip from London to Rome. In hindsight, I wish I'd booked a different airline and not booked BA based on its legacy reputation. To say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. I expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. Narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. Regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. Even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. Lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. I was also tantalised by the BA bragging of M&S supplied food. I am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. It certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. Sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. No sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. I asked what they did have. Their response 'Bottle of water or a Kit Kat'. After asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'They never give us enough food. It's mad. They give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. Needless to say that BA can no longer live on their past reputation. They had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. Sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. I'd say I'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, I won't bother. What a shame.",0.1
859,2017-04-06,Verified,"BA is now a no-frills carrier   London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier. Lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight.",0.1
860,2017-03-27,Verified,"has really gone downhill   London Heathrow to Hong Kong. The new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat, but I was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering. For a 13 hour flight in a Premium Economy I would have assumed it would be similar to others offering, meals, mid flight snacks and other bits. I was very wrong. We had a bar service and meal, there was then nothing until breakfast (exactly the same as the Economy offering). This is appalling, British Airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering. I went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft, they completely understood customer frustrations, they just have nothing to give. BA was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with. Not so much anymore. The crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had. For anyone flying BA, bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids.",0.5
861,2017-03-26,Verified,"well below every major competitor   Frankfurt to Hong Kong via London. This will definitely be my last time with British Airways, I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut to. Staff onboard were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to HKG and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline. If you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated.",0.4
862,2017-03-26,Verified,"crew to be friendly and attentive   London to Nairobi return in February, during the industrial action. We found the crew to be friendly and attentive. The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn't much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great hunks of chicken and vegetables, just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating. On the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time. Didn't much care for the cereal bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that!",0.2
863,2017-03-25,Verified,"second rate budget airline   
London Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways domestic economy, check in at T5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries North lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319. I had seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. The footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards BA. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. The management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting ""it's what our passengers asked for"". I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights. Unfortunately British Airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease it's shareholders.",1.0
864,2017-03-24,Verified,"worst short haul flight ever   Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off! Hello Star Alliance!",0.3
865,2017-03-24,Verified,"my last time to book with them   This will be my last time to book a trip with them. I booked a return trip for April 2017 from London to Istanbul a few months in advance, they ended up cancelling my 11:00 flight and moving me to the 07:00 flight which would not work for me. After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. On calling yesterday they told me that I had accepted the changes as it was months ago I told her that the other agent suggested that I wait and decide later. This was followed by the fact that I had purchased a cabin bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. Although this was not my fault. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer. I called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty. I have rebooked with Turkish Airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute, they include food, checked bag, drinks and seat selection and sometimes a Boeing 777 on this route.",0.4

The BA staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help. I was very excited to fly on the new Dreamliner from London Heathrow to Dubai, but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard. First the IFE felt very old and not clear at all, something you'd expect on non-refurbished B777's. Choice of movies and TV Shows are pretty good so I can't fault BA on that. The seats are nice, the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay. Cabin Crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us, I was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head. The food is okay (Your first meal) its hot and options were good, two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane. However and this is a big however, your second meal we were given a Breakfast Bar, that was disgraceful! How much of a budget are they on now? I thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us Breakfast bars instead, but on the return journey we were given a cookie for Lunch, people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace. I just can't believe how downhill BA has gone. It's incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too, I think they're running out of money. Unfortunately I booked my flights to Marrakech before this expereince, and I promise that would be the last time I fly with BA.",0.1
867,2017-03-22,Verified,"seats are narrow   British Airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. They make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. Seats are narrow, seat cushions are hard, and I had a ""large"" person next to me both trips. I paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. Food was passable and no more, but there were two meals on the long flight. Cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training - polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. Both flights on time. These ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been ""revamped"" they looked tired but clean. The alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft. It is tiie that BA started to compete and not be so complacent.",0.3

871,2017-03-13,Verified,"tired, worn interior   Amsterdam to Gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight, no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats, no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class. Onward flight to St Lucia, paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft. Tired, worn interior and the food reflected this too. Outbound crew were helpful and energetic, keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used. Inbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent service. The only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen, left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when I travelled home. 10/10 to British Airways staff in St Lucia for managing this so well.

I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so, so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights, I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the fares are still much more expensive. In addition, I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking.

No drink served with meal (except water). When I eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. I had a white wine.

On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served.

I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business.

883,2017-02-28,Verified,"unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby   Mumbai to Seattle via London Heathrow. I don't know why I chose to fly BA - a sense of nostalgia I think. Going to India this time, I decided to go east, via LHR and BA seemed a good idea. I will not do so again. I specifically booked all the flights through BA so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline"" - ""But BA did all the booking!"". Blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually phoned and got the PNR and checked myself in with a boarding pass. Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. When I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. The fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. Essentially despite BA being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. The flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. On the way back - forget it. Firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! When I asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the plane. I was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. The breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever had. The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. I'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I'm not fat. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta and American Airlines internationals are much better. Generally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. I'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. Its not because they are so much cheaper than others. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. What happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago? (the last time I flew BA). Overall - it's sad.",0.2

Due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to Heathrow, which I may add both my wife and I checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th March instead of 12th February. We checked in or tried to check in, whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention. We couldn't prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home. The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chance. We had no choice (over a barrel) scarcity value I hear you cry, no. We boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. My wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn't their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves. To cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedible. We will never fly BA again. British Airways - the worlds biggest rip off.",0.9
886,2017-02-26,Verified,"experience was wonderful   London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers. I couldn't fault my trip out and I am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable.",0.1
887,2017-02-25,Verified,"a journey of disappointment   London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast. Sorry BA but you are stuck in the 80s and you're slipping further down my list of preferences.",1.0
888,2017-02-24,Verified,"dreadful, stressful experience   San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great deal of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissive of customer need. On the plus side Business Class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive.

890,2017-02-20,Verified,"on a race to the bottom   London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points. The payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my future travel options. I live near Manchester Airport and KLM/Air France and Lufthansa are more attractive options.",0.5
891,2017-02-20,Verified,"treats customers with such contempt   Edinburgh to London City. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn’t as the flight had been oversold. I accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with Flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn’t be authorised so I had to ‘wait’. I then stood around for 10 minutes, being asked to ‘move out of the way’ at one point because I was blocking others. I was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. I was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. None was available nor could be contacted, apparently. I wasn’t allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight “in case” a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. I was told to wait for another 20 minutes. I argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it’s not their problem that other people had checked-in before me. I was treated as a nuisance. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there ‘waiting’ and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. I asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. He explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in, and as the check-in was closing, they could give me the seat now. I informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. I had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customer. I then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally, especially for a domestic flight). As I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. Under their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking. Some would call this cheating. The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient. I rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in.",0.5

893,2017-02-18,Verified,"Short-sighted management or what?   This a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to Business Class passengers. We were flying to Mauritius on holiday and I felt, given the flying time, we should spoil ourselves and fly up-front with all the 'comparative' comfort of Business Class. The British Airways flight itself was okay, the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine. However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it's all part of the Business Class experience). To illustrate my point, I attach a shot of what Walsh's policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare-paying passengers. With the very confusing layout that greets one in the South Terminal now that BA have moved in, the 'serve yourself' check-in (you even label your own bags!). I was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the 'Lounge'. But then to be greeted with this, was totally unacceptable. So, Willie, rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this sort of display of overt cost-cutting has now lost you revenue for the future. Short-sighted management or what? Take a lesson from Emirates who I decided to fly home with, so disgusted was I over our experience. They put passengers first!",0.4

The IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings. On the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do well. Food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was very well organised, less so at the Heathrow end.

Plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I'd flown on. I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet. No real gripes although the ""snack"" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffee.

Air conditioning wasn't working during delay - would only work once engines were on. The cabin was therefore unbearably hot. The foam in my seat 30B had deteriorated to the point I could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone. I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. This is a 12 hour flight and I don't think this is acceptable. I was very uncomfortable during this flight. In flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blipping. In flight snacks now have to be paid for. Considering the price of flights, I think this is very poor. British Airways is not a budget airline. In fact airlines currently rated lower than BA in the Top 100 airlines (eg Virgin Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines) still provide complimentary on board snacks. There were two in flight meals on this flight - on both occasions I was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out. Once, I could forgive - but twice? When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'. How rude! I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff. The quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. No crackers or cheese, no fruit. What is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake (both of which I intensely dislike). This is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting. I'd had no choice in your menu, and what was served up was unpalatable. I have to take medication that needs to be taken with food - I had no choice but to purchase food on board. An additional charge on an already expensive flight is a 'hard pill to swallow'.",0.1

Sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now (economy) but the wines are not good (I am a wine trade professional). If the food is ""M&S"" concept, why don't they get M&S to supply them the wines too? Years ago the selection process at British Airways was different and the wines were then great! But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same route. My next BA trip is on February 18th, this time to Shanghai.

It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a result. As I left the aircraft I received a text from BA asking for feedback on the flight, I took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. Whilst I was in Johannesburg I tried to contact/ call Johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at BA is like trying to get an audience with Pope Francis! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. In summary, I eventually was offered £15 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn. Looking back, the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me.",0.2

Then the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure, because of fog in the morning at Heathrow Airport. At the end we arrived with 1.5 hours delay in Zurich.

Seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards, cabin was reasonably clean. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. The time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. This was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etc. What a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary service. Sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of Lufthansa and Air France.",0.2

On return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog, but rebooking had been done by the time I checked in in PHL and I had a text message also to that effect.

Up to two years ago one felt good when travelling BA. They were miles ahead of budget airlines. Yes they were a bit more expensive, but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage, checked in cases of 20kg, all part of the service. Today BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggage. Today, within Europe, BA has absolutely no advantage opposite EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even Ryanair. Why should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. Incidentally coming back from Malta to London Gatwick in BA in business class, there is nowhere to hang coats. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. And now NO CUPBOARDS! Extra seats instead. The Decline and Fall of a once proud BA. In future BA will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines.",0.9
919,2017-01-26,Verified,"vowed to never fly with BA   I was returning home for my wedding on December 27, 2016, connecting to British Airways from London Heathrow to Abuja. The seat I had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet. I never got an explanation for this action. However, I wasn't very fussy about this as I was very excited to be getting married. Also, the flight was dirty, the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place. Our flight arrived at the Abuja airport and I was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within Nigeria. I went to claim my luggage at the carousel, I waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and I couldn't find my luggage which had my wedding items in it, including my wedding dress. As you can imagine I was devastated, I had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue. I spent the night at Abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one BA flight arrives from Heathrow to Abuja each day. My luggage never arrived the next day. Myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items. The BA staff at the airport weren't helpful at all, they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was. My luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape. Up till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven't refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them.

920,2017-01-21,Verified,"will never fly with BA again   Never again! Booked a round trip from to London from Paris return with British Airways in business as had a separate ticket from Paris to Johannesburg (with AF in business class) and Cape Town to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. The plan was to get refreshed in the lounge, rest for few hours and get on the flight. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was ""well, get a bus"". No indication of where. The woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. Tried to get some more information to which the reply was ""go online"". She gave me a paper which I thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. Thought ok, at least something. The next shock, when I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy! As I was very tired and just wanted to get home, agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. Was told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complain. Gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating ""go online, I don't care about BA"". When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. Complained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensation. Generic reply after 5 minutes was, no compensation. Needless to say, I will never fly with BA again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who I frequently fly with in business class and am a FF (luckily not of BA).",0.5

I arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin. I struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight. No idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight.

925,2017-01-18,Verified,"would I fly in BA First again? No  In September 2016, I flew with British Airways in First from London to Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033. Initial impressions were positive. The check-in was efficient with polite and friendly staff. The Concorde Room was a nice place to be. My First suite (2A) offered a good amount of comfort, space and privacy. Fast forward 12+ hours. Would I fly in British Airways First again? No. Would I fly with British Airways again? No. This is why: On the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the First cabin, with 8 passengers. The 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. I had to ask twice for a replacement set. It took over 40 minutes to receive this. Once airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. There were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served. It took over 2 hours to get my dinner. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). It would appear that this passenger had a higher Executive Club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. I was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order). This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. There were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. The First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. The ‘You First’ department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer Relations. No attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaint. This was disappointing. I was simply offered 10,000 Avios points. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”. I found this statement somewhat ironic.",0.6

If you want to buy something different, you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding. I suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true, though I suspect the real reason is cost cutting, BA just doesn’t want to admit it. BA would be better off to admit it, customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same, we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good. To tell me that charging £1.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when I can buy the same thing in Tesco for 63p insults my intelligence, they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market, again a great image to promote to the world.

I have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline. I booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and I to go from Shanghai to Zurich via London. On the way there, the flight to Zurich was cancelled due to French strike, not BA's fault so that part is clear. However, they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled, furthermore, they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours (after a 12 hours flight) to go through customs (thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers), find a hotel, arrange our own transport there and back. So the first leg already left a terrible impression. Then, on the way back to Shanghai, they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I to economy for a 12 hour flight. I booked premium economy for a reason, my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? No. Told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat, then at boarding, told us sorry it's either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat. Because I had work the next day, we had no option but to fly and BA ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap. Three months down the track, I have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbers/emails to write to, only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole.

My seat would not recline. The flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. These are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. Sadly, he did not. I was informed that the head/purser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half. Hopefully his accommodations were better than mine. Prior to landing (20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight), the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10,000 Avios.

Bought a mid-cabin seat for my wife and I. Flight delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical problem. So for the insult of paying for reasonable seats, my wife and I were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft - no refund, just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at Heathrow. Overall a loss of a half day. Thinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wasted. A couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. A suggestion that access to the British Airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment. No real remorse, matter of fact responses like gee, this happens a lot and good luck. No customer loyalty sought. Dispassionate, professional, but not really friendly.

Also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with Avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines. How sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice. Why do you think people chose British Airways? As they are more expensive?

947,2016-12-21,Verified,"give this rotten airline 0/10   Dubai to Toronto via London, and I tried to check-in online. However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA’s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a “random” security hold by airport authorities. When I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing ETA for travel to Canada. When I informed her that could not be the case as I was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA’s control. The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. As I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future leadership. In any case, this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Such is the competency and class of this “manager” but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage – adding salt to wound. I flew to London from Dubai several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them. Finally, I called the UK ""Customer Relations"" center from Toronto, but I gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. They are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too.

When I pleaded with the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers.

The food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving. Amenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and whilst the flight was quite empty in business, the service seemed to be on a go-slow.

For 'breakfast' we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick. No juice etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable. The flight attendant suggested that I should recline my seat as well and couldn't understand when I refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite.

From my experience I believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying. The aircraft are very old. If you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you 'Can you wait? service is in 20 mins' this has been tested a few times. They hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers. The next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins.

My headphone socket was crackling and the film I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time) wasn't working, it was just a black screen with audio. After travelling long haul last year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on BA. Within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers. On BA we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink.

As before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight.

We landed at Heathrow on time and reached Terminal 5 within a matter of minutes.

It was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. Crumbs on the seat. Table was sticky. Asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. Overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. Next leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still old. The housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. Asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. In general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the IFE and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). Lounge in LHR very outdated. Boarding in LHR was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. Crew on board once again very friendly and effective. Meal choice was ok. But my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. Club Kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of BA is a joke nowadays. Selection seems to go down every time I fly. Worst of all: One of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. This itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. After identifying that my bag seems to be lost I went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in Boston). I explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that I did not checked another bag -> although I had my tag that I could show to her. I had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. Manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. No apologies for inconvience at all. Last year I had one bag that was delayed. This handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. Extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. Summarizing: Flying BA for business for many years and on a regular basis now. The changes under the new boss can be seen. While in the past British Airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. This time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BA. I assume that if there is no change in the near term I will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more.

Other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken.

978,2016-11-23,Verified,"a worn out and low cost discount carrier   I booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from Bangkok to London, Angola, London, Nigeria, London and back to Bangkok. Before purchase I called the British Airways service number on website and asked if I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK - was told 'yes but have to pay a £150 fee', and nothing else a little steep but OK. I further checked extra's would be against the Visa card used to purchase the ticket, 'of course' was the reply. BA make you pay to book a specific seat now. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of £1000+. I decline this option and explain the £150 as advised (actually APP says change cost is £0). Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost - hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market - however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in Abuja (during bank open hours) - some 6 hours and 300Km's away. By now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this up with BA complaints - takes 2 month to elicit a first response - to be dealt with on one sided website. They do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone, will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights. My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier. Never again.",0.9

981,2016-11-16,Verified,"it was beyond ridiculous   Barcelona to London. Has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to Spain? According to a British Airways gate agent at Barcelona Airport, I supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave Spain. I drove across the border from the States to meet a friend in Canada and flew out from Vancouver on the same day to London for a week, and then from London to Spain for two weeks. All along the way of going through customs of Canada, UK, and Spain, I was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when I was leaving Spain. All of a sudden, this gate agent asked me “where are you going?  Where do you live?  Are you traveling alone?” I thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me “you have to wait here, I need to talk to someone.” There were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why I cannot get on the airplane.  I am a permanent resident of US; however, I am a citizen of the country participates in Visa Waver Program, which means I don’t need visa to enter Spain and definitely not when I leave. So, what’s wrong!? My name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my US Permanent Resident Card does not match with my passport. Of course, I just got married so that I have different last name from my passport, but even that, what kind of right does she have to ask me for my US Permanent Resident Card and stop me at the gate like that?! So, when she asked me if I have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name, I jokingly answered “marriage certificate??” Next thing I know was I cannot get on the airplane because I didn’t have marriage certificate with me, and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone, she said to me ""you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you.""

Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. Having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380. We were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. From the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn't hear it. This went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was ""normal"" on all their A380 aircraft. The food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. I chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. The food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the ""breakfast"" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. The standards have dropped so far it is incredible. I'm certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn't be issued with ear plugs. I'm booked to Miami once more in early 2017, fortunately on a quiet 747 and after that I will no longer fly with BA.",0.4

987,2016-11-13,Verified,"another underwhelming experience   The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a child I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of the plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old. Given the competition on this route you would think BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had to walk miles.

The situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. Apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. Not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served, the entire full cabin of 17 - by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options (747/787/747). Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this cost. Wow, a £3 saving on a £3,00o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm, as is often the case. Lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup (do they offer anything else or am I unlucky) and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea - sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. Landed without being stacked for a change. As one comes to expect with BA, underwhelming due to the bean counters at LHR cutting back - as well as increasing fares. I'd like to see the entire BA board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier.",0.3

Pilot came on the tannoy and said because there were meals being served we had to wait for 6-7 more to be delivered. This delayed the departure by 20 minutes. More afternoon teas were carried on (and crockery). Cue lots of banging and clattering in the forward galley. Crew only offered a drink once which I thought was poor for a business cabin. Not very proactive. Call bell went unanswered twice. I asked for a Baileys and ice to round off the meal when I managed to catch the attention of purser.

After an hour of ringing everybody I could at BA I ended up being passed to an offshore call centre. If you deal with BA this will be where you call for everything - cut off three times and completely incoherent. I was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in ""Club World"" seating. The plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable, it was in a dire state. My daughter commented ""this is like a dustbin with wings daddy"" when we got into the cabin. On arrival to my ""Club World"" bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere. I handed it to a stewardess who said ""that bit isn't important"" whilst looking down at me and taking it away. The inflight system was a joke, the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything. All the pixels were broken. The charging for laptops etc was US only and the remote for the entertainment system didn't work. An announcement came on before we left ""we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy. Please do not eat any nuts at anytime"". Once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut! I am proud to be British, but I am incredibly embarrassed for British Airways to represent my country in such a poor way.

Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency.

I used to fly a lot with BA for both business and pleasure. But lately they really started dropping the ball. In 2016 I had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours. But that is not the worst. Recently I booked a flight to Seville from London. After a few weeks this flight got cancelled. It took me 3 different operators to find a solution via Madrid on the same day. ('No I don't want to fly the next day!). But guess what, 1 month later my outbound to Madrid got cancelled as well. Again it took some time to find an alternative. Ultimately I had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 2.5 hours. Also I need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in Seville. After complaining to BA about this process, I expected to get some sort of compensation, after all I'm an esteemed Silver member (their words). But none of that. A few phone calls later I am stuck with an automated e-mail service replying to me that no compensation is possible. I didn't ask for any money or anything. All I asked for is to waive the re-booking fee if I ever have to change a flight. This seemed only fair after BA cancels flights willy-nilly and doesn't take the customer into account.

At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is ""an embarrassment"".

After saying hello to the host making my way to the check-in line I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me, this is business class”. Like a naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the “exclusive area”. Check-in was smooth and I was airside in under 20 minutes. Enough time for some duty-free shopping in an airport already decorated for Christmas. Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light meals or snacks especially prepared for you” and “drink from our World Wine bar” as BA promised again on their website. The only  I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight”. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my “very British experience” the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn’t stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers.

What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any.

However the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight. The inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall. Pre-landing snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about. Crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings.

With luggage booked through to final destination I was advised by Bangkok airport that, without the second boarding pass, I would have to go landside to check in at Bangkok Airways domestic check-in.

For a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food. The tuck box vanished from your offering. We got served a small breakfast at departure (9am Tokyo time) and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. Pretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed.  It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levels. Perhaps the CEO could try out this sector in World Traveller or World Traveller Plus (rather the the First class he probably uses on a long haul flight) and see how he feels at the end of it! Maybe he will turn a little skinnier! Certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience!",0.8

I slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol. The only reason I fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and I dislike the club seating arrangement. Apart from breakfast scrambled eggs I hardly eat on long haul. Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it's a bonus if you get some ex Concorde crew. I never want to board the aircraft early as I know that I will not have trouble stowing my bags in first. A previous review complained that on the 787 there is only one toilet in first but there are only 8 seats.

A 2 year old A380, the seats were much nicer than the 777-200 outbound flight - seat 82a, I did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor (can't say if that's a good thing for BA or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first A380 flight). That's the positives out of the way. No sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gate. Cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding. 7pm departure so I was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as I could. At 9:30pm meal arrived, no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals. I got a bread roll she didn't, she got a dessert I didn't, neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty I had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a Diet Coke! Woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it. A folded omelette 2.5 potato wedges and a cherry tomato, (breakfast of kings). The final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long I had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives. The 20 minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing. My quick connecting flight to Manchester was pretty much the same too.

Cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. That feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. The entertainment system just about kept the children entertained - but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack, quality 'kids' treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.If you have a choice go with another airline.

The majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups. Perhaps that's why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight. The cheaper no checked baggage tickets, allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage, cause chaos on boarding, with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers. Consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place. All semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned, there is no welcome on board, only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage. The seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable. Cabin so called service, was nonexistant. The packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse, and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea. The cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through ""meal"" service to maximise time available to chat in the galley. The one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time, and arrived 10 minutes early. I was only on the flight as part of a tour group.

After 45 minutes of waiting, they were finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Here's where BA's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA. We chose Kenya Airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. No, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger. The bottom line is, don't fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligible.

Very disappointed in all of it. Our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to Gatwick was struck by lightening which is not BA's fault I know but I would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past. Maybe they just don't have spare planes any more long haul.

Who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet?  Even worse is what British Airways sells as business class within Europe. They are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. Could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! They are the only international carrier that does this.

We submitted a formal complaint on our return via BA website. It took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in London.

Again. So clear evidence of passenger inequality at BA, even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class. This happened 2 weeks ago when flying from London Heathrow to Larnaca. Firstly, why do I, who flies several times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to ""choose"" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from? Secondly, why do BA offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets. As it should be with every airline. But BA appear to suffer from some kind of 'seat hoarding' issue for some reason.

We made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the beds. The config of First Class in BA is 1-2-1 with 2 aisles. This is not as good as the Etihad First which has a central aisle with individual cabins (called apartments) of the aisle. Never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow.

Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point.

First when checking in in Abu Dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new Boeing 787. Of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. Passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on, eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in. The actual flight time was 14:00, then the plane was delayed yet again. British Airways staff were no where to be found! Eventually a supposed British Airways manager arrived. We then couldn't check in because the system was broken, after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in Uni.! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. Then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for Uni was missing, apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. Again no communication from British Airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. Sad thing is that in the move to Uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag, when we explained this to the BA phone operator, she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. Thank you BA for the great advice. Now sitting on the plane returning to home to Abu Dhabi (same plane) 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine.

Complained to Customer Service after arriving home and was told the caterer at LHR was to blame and they didn't want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals. Seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said. Crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated. Hard to recommend BA but given the competition on this route, and the desire to stay with One World/BA FFP, it's a poor choice.",0.8

It seems British Airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that it's turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices. I only fly with them now when tour operators give me no choice. Ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths, refusing to change my seat because ""that's what the computer has allocated"". Boarding was the now expected shambles. The no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premium. On this flight several were removed from lockers, and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front, thus severely restricting leg room. Cabin staff were rude and uncaring. Again now the norm for BA. The in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea.

British Airways flight BA632 from LHR to Athens on 11th September was by far the worst cabin crew that I have encountered in 45 years of flying. The crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in Business Class, and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. After 1.5 hours in the air, we were offered a drink, the champagne was undrinkable, and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. After that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. That was all the service we received on the whole flight of 3.5 hours. No top up of drinks no offer of water, and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking.

This is the second time this has happened with British Airways in the last few months, who really should not be offering an online check-in service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection! I called them to enquire why they do this, to which the reply was that most seats are ""restricted"" on online check-in. They did sort the seat I wanted however as I'm flying with my Mother who obviously I want to be sat next to. Yet when I looked yesterday at the option of paying £15 for a seat reservation before online check-in opens, there was a good choice available. If British Airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat, and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying, then they should abolish the online check-in as it's clearly not providing the service it should do - Online check-in means being able to choose from several seats, not being unacceptably limited to 4 seat choices only, just 20 seconds after online check-in has opened!",0.5

No newspapers available, when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing BA could provide them in the premium cabin. So called 'Brunch' was served, which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato, lettuce leaf and cucumber. Very poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flight. This to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how BA expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets.

Finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. Lounge in Atlanta was mediocre at best. Flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren't anything special. I'd say BA First Class is average at best when compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines. My baggage didn't arrive at Heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with BA lost baggage - it was finally delivered almost a week later. Overall, not the kind of service that you would expect when flying First Class. Raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks (and four follow up calls to customer relations), who said that since my agent had booked my Knoxville flight that was due to land in Atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to Heathrow, their system ""automatically took my booking off"" - I don't know whether this is normal but I've never come across this issue before in all my years of flying.

In AMS, when checking in for that flight, this seat was still granted, 2.5 hours later at gate I was reallocated to 14G on main deck.

No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits?

As we didn't land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. We were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts! We complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of August. What a disgrace. We regularly fly BA and are silver card holders, however, we've decided to fly our next two long haul flights with Emirates. The BA planes we've flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality.

The travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance. I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to London. At Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. The departure board did not show the check-in area for the BA flights. I had to find my own way to where BA check-in. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. When other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful. The departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. The cabin crew were very professional. The departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. My seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. Arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags. When things go well, BA is excellent. However, charges for baggage are outrageous and place BA in the same category as budget airlines.

I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?",0.2

At check-in I spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junk-fee for a single piece of luggage. Again I had to call BA 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. The second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk-fee. The third call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting BA's mistakes. I spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. The BA lounge at TXL is small and does not have a toilet.

1060,2016-08-14,Verified,"friendly and professional   London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at Heathrow. The departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. However the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. Once on board I found the cabin to be very clean. Unlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. However the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system provided is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. This option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. The service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. Arrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficient. The return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleep. Unfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration. A marked contrast to the experience at YVR.",0.5

On this last flight a week ago, the plane has been internally reconfigured, and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 1/3 of the space, and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normal-sized adult. I have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - I offered to send BA this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint, see below. The discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours - for which I did not blame the airline - meaning I spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. Then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre-landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar, approximately 2 inches in size. As a result I arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would have brought food on the flight had I known of the miserly cost-cutting measure in advance. I wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration, as this can't easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. I ended my complaint saying I had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers. I've just received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint, indicating that it was not even read, and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy.

Superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service.

Started badly - at check-in and gate boarding World Traveller passnegers are made to feel second-class citizens, but this seemed worse at Bengaluru (choatic) than Heathrow. The plane itself was packed to capacity, probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. I had chosen an aisle seat in the centre (seat 38D) at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. Leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. Seat width is OK. The adjustable headrest is better than that in Premium Economy (World Traveller Plus) although the seat base is hard. For a 10 hour flight I recommend sitting on the cushion. Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. To be expected to put up with a seat without VOD for 10 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast after 2hrs, in then a snack box after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately, while I thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first, that was not the case, and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone. No connectivity in seat, only earphone socket. VOD choice quite limited compared to other airlines. Unfortunately I think that British Airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the Middle and Far Eastern carriers in future.",1.0

I always used to look forward to the big seats, a boozy afternoon watching movies and being treated a little bit special. Fast forward and the lounges are generally borrowed from other airlines that make you feel like a second class citzien, the planes are tired with worn out interiors and all of this is reflected in other passengers dissapointment in a generally lack lustre flying experience. For better value and added smiles I've found the premium economy offering must better value for money.",0.5

Only to find when we got on the plane that the seats given to us were not functional. We had no entertainment on the 12 hour flight, no power to the seat so could not even read. British Airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade, as they advise their responsibility is to get us from A to B. The entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price. Even though looking at their website they state ""personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones"" as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy. The fact that we did not even get to watch the security video is not a concern to BA. As someone who flies BA a lot, they have just lost a customer and do not care. I would avoid flying BA now.

1076,2016-07-16,Verified,Shocking customer service   We travelled from Aberdeen to Heathrow and on to San Francisco with no issues other than very poor legroom. Even less legroom than on a local flight to Europe (Ryanair) on a 10 hour flight. On the return journey the first flight from San Francisco to Heathrow was delayed. Once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy. So they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were. Very scary in view of the security situation. Then our row of 3 seats had no in-flight entertainment (row 28) The first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it. Then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink. So we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment. On landing at Heathrow our next flight to Aberdeen was also delayed for one hour. On complaining to BA they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds. Not much use if you intend never to fly BA again. Shocking customer service. Avoid Heathrow and particularly BA at Heathrow.,0.1

Quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals - they have been ""taught"" to do everyone individually. That doesn't work when they have expanded the number of passengers. Cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. They disappeared after lunch for many hours - until it was time for tea.

1085,2016-07-02,Verified,lost my business forever   Cannot believe how bad British Airways was. We arrived very early at the airport in Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight to London in premium economy. They would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. It is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers. British Airways has lost my business forever.,0.2

The next one (and I cannot believe I am saying this) was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in CW and First.

Flying in Club Europe from London City to Berlin Tegel, returning in economy with British Airways. The outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. The food offered in the CE cabin was delicious. Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. I had done my online check in on my return flight. Just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. The check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. She checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn't bother. When I was queuing up at the passport control, I noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had cleared through security. BA staff were shocked that I was checked in under someone else's name. Wrong name, Wrong flight etc. They asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY. They gave me a new luggage tag. After arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. I approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone.

1091,2016-06-18,Verified,"passing off economy seats as business   We travelled on BA 633 from Athens on 12th of June, 2016. The flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. British Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. To be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  If we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy.",0.8

Having booked our flight from Alicante to Gatwick I immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of €23 each. When I came to check in online, 24 hours before the flight, I found that we had been moved to row 30, the very back of the plane. When I selected 'Change your Seat' row 4 was not even displayed. I am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. For this reason I am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not and have not received any notification from BA to tell me they had changed the seating. Nor have I received my money back. While waiting to board the plane I received a text message survey on my BA experience so far. I participated and gave a summary of the situation. I also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. When I got home I gave BA one day to contact me but when they did not I submitted a complaint through their website. After some days I got a reply saying: 'Would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? We’ll be more than happy to see if you’re eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight'. I cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. But with BA you have to 'claim' a refund and then wait while they 'check your eligibility'. My family take many flights each year including long hauls to Asia.

At that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. At check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. After some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. At security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. Security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. When I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn't keep quiet. Once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and I requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. It arrived but I was told I could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. The flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. The staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. On talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. I had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. In the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and I was allowed to accompany her all the way. To add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep.

The lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. The BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms that were full. The flight was late and chaotic. A group of loud boisterous men, were virtually running the economy cabin, roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits.

Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever.

After tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. Obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. The on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. At this point I did venture down to the British Airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, I gave up and sat down again. At 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. During all of this time I should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines BA was conspicuous by its silence. We were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. Despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. Eventually we boarded just after 14.30. When everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. Various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from Gatwick being dumbed down by BA in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of Heathrow. I have no idea whether this is true or not but I would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from Heathrow to JFK, would BA have found a solution quicker? Once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay.",0.8
1102,2016-06-05,,"a mediocre service A mediocre service on this airline flying from London Heathrow to Stuttgart, which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. Check-in process was fine at Heathrow. After security, I went to the first class lounge on the south side of Heathrow terminal 5. The lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. The hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. There were a few bland sandwiches available as well. While the lounge itself is in a beautiful, large room, it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. Boarding process was seamless at the gate. The plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. There is very little legroom available and if you're taller than 5'11"", you're knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. Food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum. No inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever was available, which is really a disappointment given that so many other airlines are now installing this. Overall, the trip was fine but the onboard and lounge experiences could be improved.",0.2

This also had an impact on the speed of getting off the plane when we arrived in Bucharest. They should have been stricter with the cabin luggage allowance.

Seats in Business Class are not assigned until 48 hours before flight time. However, and here comes another BA first: If you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee. I ended up shelling out $484 - for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight. This on top of the steep fare charged for travel in Business Class.

1116,2016-05-20,Verified,"poor customer service   My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. The redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. Big mistake. Since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. Here is the reply we received from BA customer relations: ""We've received a reply from Mumbai who've investigated your case. The agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. He did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. He also mentioned BA wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" This is an outright lie. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. Poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up.",0.1

The hardware again is very dated - tiny screen, old seat and interior. Legroom was decent though, and because the flight is empty I had plenty of space to stretch out. The flight left JFK with a minor delay. As it's a light flight most passengers were sleeping. Service was done in a very discreet way. The food quality is nothing to write home about. Overall it's a typical BA flight. Very efficient and friendly crew with a very dated and unattractive product. We arrived at Heathrow early despite the late departure in JFK.

I had no interest in reserving a regular seat (I could wait until 24 hours before check-in for that) but I was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats. So I paid the $118 for the two front-section seats. When my wife and I boarded the craft, lo and behold, the seats were not front-section seats at all! I was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my Android Phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely, apologizing to us, offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of post-flight. However, subsequent to the flight, British Airways has been positively nasty in their response, claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued (true enough) and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front-section when they were not. The fact that I received zero goods or services for my $118 beyond what I was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them. They have managed to bilk me out of $118 and having gotten their hands on my money, they intend to keep it.

There is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - I would actually prefer easyjet and Ryanair as at least they are transparent. This journey from Lyon to London Heathrow was chaotic and stressful. Thanks to BA charging £30 to check in luggage one way, every passenger takes cabin baggage. This means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. The boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - I have honestly never seen anything like it. Once on board, they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn't fit. Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. The meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwich. As always with BA flights to and from LHR, this flight was late. We ended up flying round and round over London for 30 mins. The worst thing is BA's new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening 24 hours before. This means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay £12 just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom). BA's new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process).

The seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. No leg room and BA attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (A/C and D/E). The problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. At least If the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. Our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. Flight was full in business (9 rows taken up) and quickly became stuffy.

On the return flight the seats were worn and old, screens were old and scratched the children weren’t given their choice of meals as they had run out, my three year old was given snack a box containing nuts my husband sitting next to her was asleep I was in the row behind and quickly took it away as she’s allergic. I could go on but you get the picture. The man sat next to me didn’t get any food on a 7hr plus flight – he was vegetarian and they had run out of pasta. From my experience I won’t fly or recommend British airways anymore. The days of glory are long gone.",0.1

When I reached Terminal 5 they bumped me due to overbooking. They offered me a downgrade that I could not accept for health reasons. If they had told me they were overbooked when I tried to check in online, I could have rerouted via New York and still arrived in time for an important meeting. As it was, I arrived 7 hours late and missed my meeting. British Airways only cares about maximising its profits. It cares nothing for its passengers. I have been a loyal customer of BA for over 50 years. For many years I was a gold card holder and this is how they treat me. They sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after I had paid the full and non refundable fare. They used to be good. their strapline, ""The World's Favourite Airline"" was not far from the truth. No longer! They are rapidly becoming the world's least favourite airline",0.1

This time, we had the experience of the new Boeing 787 which was very nice and new, and we found the seats just as comfortable, particularily in Premium Economy. What we did not enjoy was the change in attitude from the staff, they seemed so different to the crews we had looking after us on the previous runs. The emphasis was on getting things served as fast as they can, and woe betide you if you want extra milk for your cup of coffee! The food was good, and we felt safe and efficiently cared for, but there was not the fun around that we used to encounter when wandering around in the small hours of the flight, when you could go to the galley and get a coffee or a snack. After all this is a long haul flight, and I can well understand the rush on a short haul flight. The person behind us was air sick, which was not their fault, and the cabin crew dealt with this well. Our return flight was better, and we enjoyed the glass of fizzy prior to take off, which is a nice touch, and is something that other airlines do in Premium Economy. I think that BA managers should travel with other airlines to review its premium economy brand. Finally, I think the breakfast is not very nice, and could be improved upon.

It transpires we have to contact BA ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. This sums up British Airways now, as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they aren't provided with and then BA making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money, customer service is non existent. Other than this, all 4 flights we took were late, our son was given child meals we hadn't booked, the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting, one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats. An internal Virgin America flight we took had more space and more comfortable seating than BA's A380. I cannot find anything positive to say about them.",0.5

Captain had to announce unless people sat down and allowed hand baggage to be placed in hold, plane would be further delayed. British Airways needs to decide whether it wants to be a no frills airline or not, it is now worse than Ryanair or Easyjet. Not a pleasant experience to fly BA anymore. Despite having problems of one type or another on nearly every booking made with BA in the last few years, continued to be loyal to them but they do not appreciate customer loyalty despite their recorded customer services message claiming they want to maintain high standards after travel and wish to ensure a passenger flies with BA again, they fail on all counts.",0.1

It was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable, though quite full. The BA Club seats are configured 8 across and the seat is not as wide as competitor's, but just enough. CX may have better seat but BA sometime offers good value. The service is good.

The food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional. Drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently. Washrooms were clean. Overall a satisfactory experience. However, one thing almost all travellers on the YVR-LHR route will notice is the age of this aircraft. I think it should be replaced soon, since this is a very popular route. I flew in late March and return beginning of April, being low season but the cabin was still full. I think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the A380. Particularly, the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket. The in-flight entertainment system is also very out dated, pictures were not clear and colours were rather misleading.",0.8

The upper deck situation means that I can take advantage of a window side drawer where apart from easy storage I can also put something on top. And Premium Economy offers just enough space to move out if needed. BA's Premium Economy service is good, the food is not the same for economy as in the case of some airlines, and the seat acceptably comfortable.

To make matters worse, the counter for lost baggage which operates on behalf of British Airways was very poorly marked. There was no sign or logo of British Airways. It was manned by two person which hadn't had a clue what was going on and would only assist in filling up the forms.

The fish main course served between IAD and LHR was unbelievably bad, but other meals were fairly good.

Outbound flight was with American Airlines that was so much better. New aircraft, good entertainment and food with was good.

Zero legroom unless you are in row ""1"". Last month I flew the regional Business Class on Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Needless to say - British Airways does not come close when it comes to seat comfort. Disgraceful. Food okay on both flights. FAs on both flights were also fine.

The new economy seating feels incredibly camped, the food on offer is of poor quality and of increasingly smaller portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't see any reason to continue to fly this airline. I also find it ridiculous that BA charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance, making me have to stress out about checking in on time while on vacation to ensure that I can snap up whatever good seat is left by that time. My next trip to Europe has been booked with American, and I am already seeing a difference - I was able to choose a regular seat for free at the time of booking, and I will accrue the full amount of miles that I am actually flying.

He asked his colleague who had other boarding passes, that still wouldnt scan. His other colleague thought it might be my passport and went off to check. I made the point that I had been in the airport three hours so if there was something wrong, surely they could have contacted me? The colleague came back. The bar codes still wouldnt scan and I heard one of them say 'they are already through'. I said I had booked a window seat for hubby and hoped the new one was. He said they were but by their numbers I could see they werent. Got on board. There was someone already in those seats!! I found an attendant, who went off and found us two seats. No window, across the aisle from the loo. So all night we heard the loo flushing and got bumped by people waiting and falling about due to turbulence. That would be why they were free.  I did look to where my booked seats were. There was a family of five in that row, that obviously wanted to be together. So though I was in a different bit of the cabin that might have been premium economy, as I was offered a hot flannel and some warm fizzy win in a plastic glass, I was certainly not upgraded.

Breakfast was not good enough for an airline of this supposed calibre - small cold cheese croissant and muesli bar! Only one tea/coffee round and then they whipped round to collect the empties.

Crew on return were impersonal, and keen to get the dinner service over. Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience. This is what you get with a quasi-monopoly to the USA from London. The only merit was the superb A380.

Flights on time, nice new / refurbished plane, cabin crew worked hard throughout. Food actually quite decent - nice breakfast out and tea on the way back. Sadly the seat space same as economy, when the guy in front reclined I couldn't even open the paper, just about ok for 90 minutes. So worth paying a little more for against economy but not too much.",0.8
1177,2016-03-07,,"you're flying cattle class Stockholm to London Heathrow was not a pleasant experience. British Airways has a good way of reminding you that you're flying cattle class. The interior was tired and worn, and the seat was hard. The legroom was inadequate for a short-haul flight. The cabin service was variable, while some were courteous, others practically barked at you. One steward even tapped me and gestured me for a refill.  On the bright side, there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol. I have had the fortune of sitting in front of three very loud and progressively intoxicated ladies who pressed for the stewardess for more alcohol every 10 minutes on the flight - requests promptly obliged. Perhaps I should have taken the advantage of this generosity to make the flight more bearable.",0.8
1178,2016-03-07,,"food offered was pretty basic London to Helsinki return. Check in at T3 quick as was fast track security. I visited the BA lounge in T3 which is nice and used by other Oneworld airlines, apart from being packed there was very limited food on offer at 10am. Boarding was slow and done by bus to a remote stand, onboard the seated in 1A with a fee seat next to me. I was looking forward to something decent to eat due to the lack of food options in the lounge - unfortunately the food offered was pretty basic to say the least. The crew where friendly which I guess was something. Arriving in Helsinki on time to another remote stand and bus transfer bags where off quickly despite any priority tagging. Check in for the return was quick, security a little slow but once through I headed for the Finnair lounge which was packed with no seating. I managed to find a seat in a computer booth have a coffee and check my emails. Boarding was awful with no priority and once again a 10 minute bus ride on a packed bus to then stand in the freezing cold and sleet for a further 10 minutes boarding via steps. After a delayed 1hr departure service began with a drink followed by another very basic meal of 3 half sandwiches and a scone. Crew were okay and kept passengers updated on the delayed arrival. Finally arrived 1 hr late but with the luxury of an airbridge. Bags off quickly which was good. Otherwise a business class on a 3hr flight with no in seat power, economy seating with middle seat blocked. Standard food offered in economy on other airlines. There is no class in BA's European business class anymore. Added to the poor downgrading of the BA frequent flier scheme it's a no brainer for me.",0.4
1179,2016-03-06,,"excessive hand baggage Flew from EDI-LHR-PHL-LHR-EDI in World Traveller. Outbound shuttle to Heathrow was a Boeing 767-300 in all economy layout, managed to bag seats 1F/1G using online checkin. Cheery, friendly crew - biggest problem is the excessive hand baggage allowance permitted on BA. Selfish people take huge cases on board, filling up the lockers so everyone with more modestly sized items can't get a look in. Cabin crew quite stressed trying to move cases around lockers to get everyone sat down. LHR-PHL upgraded to the rearmost group of two seats on Row 35 on  Boeing 777-200. BA has now cheekily increased the cost of these to £48 each - used to be only £33 like the rest of the cabin. Wisecracking captain over the tannoy made the flight a little more entertaining - again great crew, I could eat the meal for once. Only thing that went wrong was the IFE on my seat crashed in the last 90 minutes of the flight - I could only view the flight tracker. On a side note, I wish BA would upgrade the album choice, they haven't changed it in the last year. Flight was on time no delays. Inbound PHL-LHR I reserved a seat for £33 each, but note you cannot buy the back row on the middle group - reserved for the crew. Plane encountered severe turbulence between Nantucket and Newfoundland, crew had to rush the drinks and the meal service as a result.  No apologies from the pilots about this which BA usually does. LHR-EDI problems about excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller A320.  It was the same steward by sheer coincidence that served us on the outbound shuttle a week earlier and he did remember us, and asked us how our holiday in Philadelphia went! Otherwise flight was pleasant and did what it said on the tin. Overall it was a good value trip - I booked it through BA Holidays, and it being off-season meant the total cost was £940 (before seat upgrades) including 8 days car rental. One observation however it that it is now clear that BA cares little about its economy passengers (who now seem to exist to make up the numbers) - everything now seems to be geared around their high-spending Executive Club members. Avios earning has been drastically cut in the World Traveller cabin class, so a discounted fare now only attracts 0.25 Avios in the mile. Therefore a transatlantic flight to the East Coast of the USA (which used to get 3250 points), now only attracts a measily 815. Pretty pathetic really. I really only use British Airways via LHR for USA trips purely on the basis of using large widebody planes (unlike American and United who increasingly use Boeing 757s) , and their holidays deals which are hard to beat and enable payment instalments.",0.3
1180,2016-02-28,,"flight was amazing Washington to Heathrow with British Airways and I have to say that the IAD ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. I sprained my neck just 2 days before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. The flight itself was amazing - the A380 is just like a rock in the sky, I didn't feel a thing. The seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on United. The premium economy is more like domestic business class on most US carriers (older style business class not the new business first). The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. They are hard to find if they even exist. I'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best I got was a brusque ""sorry that's all there is."" When you see someone limping away from your desk - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge. I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately.",0.5

I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat. I certainly wouldn't pay BA's rate for Premium Economy again.",0.7

The Concord Lounge at LHR has seen better days - ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic, so left it! Champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. Nuts were pleasant. Seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. First choice of food not available, which is unacceptable in First. Then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. Staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. We ended being split up, partner on row 4, me on row 2! Nice start to our honeymoon, thanks BA. Cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. Staff upgrades are commonplace on BA in First and the cabin had by my reckoning, 5 paying passengers and I'd say about 4 staff upgrades (all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate). These 'mates' of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. Personally I'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat, but BA seem to think it's acceptable for staff to travel in First. If you're on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade, I'd say you're chances are pretty remote, unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight! A pretty poor experience all round which proves that the once 'worlds favourite airline' has become so complacent that they can't even get it right in First Class. Is it any wonder the Middle East carriers are showing the rest of the world how to do it!",0.2

No BA employees were there. Could not get BA on the phone. Woman from another airline booked us on Delta in regular economy. Have spent since August trying to get a refund of the $700 pp extra I paid for premium economy. Finally got the refund. Was $149 pp with no explanation.

The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry.

I was looking forward to my first flight on the Boeing 787 -  so much so, I switched from Singapore / LHR to KL when I discovered the 787-9 operated on this route. The new plane is very nice indeed - the so called ""new"" - New First is not. BA trumpet they have listened to customers and this revised version was to be the new pace setter. Wrong. The FAs on the route were great and dinner was adequate. The chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad was fine. The wine was also fine. The cheap champagne nowhere near to Krug as served by other carriers in 1st Class. The usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware - we have to get used to. The seat is definitely more constrained than the 777 and A380 1st Class; its tighter and smaller. In bed mode - it is like sleeping on a park bench. So hard. The ridiculous ""island"" design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the 777 and A380. When lying on your side it digs into your back. The seat's narrow profile becomes very obvious. You have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the ""compartment"". I am 6 4"" tall and not overweight. I did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the A380 flight I took to Singapore last month. The TV screen is larger and fixed - which does not lend itself to a companion dinning with you as on the other aircraft. Its on a slight angle as well slightly facing away from the viewer. The AV remote is small and overly complicated. There is no WiFi. There is no window blinds as on the other aircraft. The windows can be dimmed to ""black"" - so you have two black orbs staring at you through the flight. BA seem clueless when it comes to a top end 1st Class. I will avoid this plane in future.

It did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. On the first call, there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. Fortunately we were cut off as I think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. Second call was more successful and a direct answer was given, no matter how unwelcome. Printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at LHR (I am not a frequent air traveller). A sign of the times perhaps but I did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. Not much to say about bag drop off. It was neither efficient nor inefficient, just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. The young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by Friday. At the gate, I did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area - all of 3 metres away. I suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices, because they will of course get there first! The flight was just about adequate. My video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified - well I was ignored. Fortunate, as the film and TV choice was poor.  I do not like airline food that much. There are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really drink the wine. Beer and spirits hard to get wrong. Return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. Again the flight was just about adequate. Did not eat the food as I had a salad from an outlet at YVR - good value. Flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. The seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. The only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit, and stand at the back. Whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front, she did not want to be reasonable. The attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution.",0.9

British Airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. Is this really the way BA wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little.

Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. Onboard, the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity kit - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with drinks served first. The evening meal was average at best and overcooked, with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece, you can see the cuts and money saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now - the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger, no flower in the toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment choices. Crew were the usual indifferent long haul ""I'm here as a favour to you all"" with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service! I think the main problem British Airways have is a dated cabin product. The ying yang seating in it's day was innovative and one of the first lay flat beds. Now, crawling over a stranger to reach the isle, being bumped by people and carts if you're on the aisle, and a lack of storage space mean that the BA product is way inferior to Air Canada and a lot of the middle eastern carriers.

After checking in online and paying an extra £45 each way per person to reserve seats after already paying over £4000 for our flights (wasn't a major issue and was expected), we discovered that selecting our outgoing seats was fine, but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin. Being a nervous flyer I was not up for sitting by myself for nearly 9 hours so we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage drop off point, the gentleman working behind the drop off was as helpful as he could be, but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left Punta Cana, and that it wasn't likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers. Getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane, with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay, flight attendants then offered us drinks - once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for and we were happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. But then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staff's family were on board and they were all staying in Punta Cana for 5 days before flying home. One member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class - and walked past everybody else. My partner then asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them. When we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water. 1 hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. All staff in our cabin looked half asleep, with hair all over the place. Considering this was a 2pm flight you'd have thought it was an evening flight.

1226,2015-12-30,,"only book BA if lowest fare British Airways from Vienna to Newcastle via Heathrow return, flights on-time. Economy on an A320. FA’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on VIE legs the FA’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. Information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. A snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the VIE flights and crisps/biscuits on the NCL flights. Additional drinks on request. A320 featured the new slim seats and I miss the older more comfortable BA seats with better leg room. BA has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). If one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR 75 at the airport or EUR 35 online. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. So, BA became a low cost model, except for drinks service. However the prices do not reflect this change in service. On the last leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was heavily policed. Although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous BA flights, I was required to check it in. It was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. Hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. However, here goes the main advantage of BA, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. Boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. Instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. Another thing is, that recent changes in BA’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly Club on long distance routes. Obviously, BA is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. While I stopped flying Business with BA probably a year ago after they downgraded their Club Europe cabin and I was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, I believe BA’s European economy was a great product and I was using BA regularly for those flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book BA if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. For flights to the UK, KLM starts to look pretty good again.",0.1

It's time BA stopped taking it's domestic (no competition routes) for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trips, the numbers onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fees now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on, puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for how long now?

The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20 minutes. Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if I can find some biscuits for you"". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American accent for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake.

However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration.

1246,2015-12-10,,"BA really did not care I have flown British Airways Business Class and was pleased with Lounge, food service, Elemis Spa, showers wit Elemis products and on request champagne. Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. My review is for First only.",0.9
1247,2015-12-09,,"relaxing and luxurious Fantastic flight in Club World with British Airways from London Gatwick to Punta Cana. On time departure from Gatwick on a 777-200 - it's true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin, but seats 2A and 2B were comfortable and functioning perfectly. Greeted by friendly mixed-fleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off. Prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices. I enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad, followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty. The delicious Castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so I recommend ordering this promptly. As this was a leisure flight, all champagne did run out about 3 hours in, for which the crew apologised sincerely, but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent Chablis and Medoc. The Club Kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help. Plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing. Bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly. The entertainment system was great in Club with a decent selection of new release films, though the screen resolution could be better, especially Wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full. We were kept well informed of the flight progress throughout by a cheery and personable First Officer, who navigated a mean-looking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb.

Flight was punctual and we had a few hours sleep. Coming back was in Premium Economy and might as well have been on a different airline. Same old plane with TV screens extremely small. Meals not particularly great. The main difference is that British Airways crew treat anybody flying in a lower class as lesser individuals and they are bordering on rude. They forget that whatever class of cabin you are flying in that you are the customer and pay their wages. Next time Malaysia Airlines I think.,0.5
1251,2015-12-01,,"flights therefore very uncomfortable Washington to Dubai via London return with British Airways. My concern is regarding seat allocation. When we booked our flight (2 adults, one child and one infant), the seats with the bassinets for the infants were not available. We then chose 3 seats together on the side. I presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the needs of the passengers that are traveling with children. Nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats were taken by single individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. I asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". That was not the case, unfortunately. The flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. I do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. British Airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. The priority seating chart is for that purpose useful.",0.5

The toilet at the front of the aircraft was so unbelievably small as to be difficult to use. We consider that the conditions we had to put up with were quite unsuitable for a four hour flight. I am puzzled why British Airways would choose to offer such a miserable Business Class experience, it would be more honest and cause less disappointment if they were to declare all their European A320 flights to be economy only.",0.9
1255,2015-11-30,,"British Airways have lost the plot I think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The London to Barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. It started at Grantley Adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. We sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so I had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. There were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents I would presume. Next the food, abysmal! A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). Breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. I have travelled with British Airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from Singapore and Malaysia with British Airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. The cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. I asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. I did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance. British Airways have lost the plot and are up against great airlines such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines, although sadly not on the Barbados route.",0.3

They back tracked and I was informed my claim was authorised and it would take 6/8 weeks. British Airways need to stop this practice as it does not show the Airline in a good light.

My issue is the inconsistency with the cabin crew who can vary from pleasant to rude and cut corners with the service when they can. I appreciate that the LGW base is a ""low cost"" base for BA, but there is no excuse for the crew to behave as they do. easyJet and Vueling crew look more professional and are more pleasant on the same route. The LGW lounge is tired and average at best. It needs a good clean. FCO still has no lounge after the fire in the summer nor have any other arrangements been made.

I don't like the weird front to back 2x4x2 layout and cannot forsee how much longer British Airways can get away with this as it is so out of date with modern standards. It is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you. Having watched the seating pattern filling up over several months I eventually paid £136 extra to reserve a window seat both ways. After a couple of hours the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent. That said, the crew were polite and served well. They seemed to be older and I think that makes the difference, they understand customer service. On the return, one cabin crew in particular was very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated and this time the service was good.

Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice.

Used to be a big fan of BA but recent negative reviews made me a bit nervous. Well, my experiences on board the 2 flights were excellent. Cabin Services Directors on both flights were approachable, courteous and professional and team members exemplary. The boarding in Geneva was efficient, seat was comfortable for economy class and the flight departed before time. The sandwich and drinks provided were appreciated. On time arrival in Heathrow Terminal 5. The process of getting to the Beijing flight was relatively quick. The flight to Beijing was a 3 year old Boeing 777-300 series and my seat was 37A - the emergency exit seat that quite a few people have complained about because it has no window and the emergency slide box on the door limited leg room. I am 6' 3"" tall and there was more than enough space for my long legs. Bar service offered shortly after take off. The food was good (smoked salmon starter, beef/rice dish,  chocolate orange mousse). IFE was excellent (compared to the United flights I had taken to the USA earlier in the month) with a good selection of films and TV shows. During the flight, the crew came by with trays of drinks. Breakfast was a cooked breakfast with muesli starter, orange juice and a bread roll. Coffee refills were offered. The flight landed on time. I really could not fault the planes, service or food on both flights. Economy seating is cramped these days but BA seats are no worse/no better than other airlines. The return flights to Geneva a week later were just as good.",0.1

Was in row 10 on both the outgoing and incoming (night) flights. Seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy. I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person. I had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. Never saw them again.

We were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked us to go this woman, from the outset she was not happy. We were a party of 8 and she only wanted to check in 2. She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline. I feel BA need to know how their passengers are treated by agent staff. I have not included this experience in my rating of BA. Once through check-in the flight experience was excellent.",0.5

The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways don't. Even other, newer, BA planes have far superior seats and VOD, to which it is shocking the difference in the service offered for economy class, there isn't even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes.

Since at one point it appeared likely our slot might not open up till 16.00 (scheduled at 10.20) the food and drink service was started, and cabin crew did a great job keeping a congenial atmosphere in the cabin whilst doing this. Eventually we did get a slot at 14.00 and got into Heathrow round 16.30. It was quite stressful for those passengers who had connections to make (I did make my connection that afternoon to Washington), but the stress was reduced by continuous up-to-the-minute information from the flight deck and service from cabin crew.",0.6

If it was grilled, it must have been a long time before it was refrigerated. Not too good. The fillet was like a piece of old shoe leather. I will admit that it might be difficult to come up with a medium rare steak but this was bad. I was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. I was never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask for some. I was not offered any after dinner drink. In short, the service was rushed and more like a coach class. It appeared that the attendants were trying to get rid of us and get us to sleep rather than serve us. I was very disappointed and would avoid British Airways business class.

BA used to have a fast bag drop desk for customers who have checked in online. When I enquired as to where it was on arrival at Manchester Airport I was directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated, ""We don't have one. You have to join the back of the queue"". In that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online?! It serves no purpose whatsoever. The shuttle down to Manchester was delayed by about an hour as was our onward flight from LHR to LAS. This flight was on one of their ancient B747-400 aircraft which was 25 years old, and it showed. The seats in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a 10.5 hour flight and there was no legroom. Inflight entertainment options were poor. I have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight. The in flight catering was mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service. Our return flight from LAS to LHR was delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from T5 at LHR I received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into T3 at LHR. As we were already delayed into LHR, by the time we had crossed to T5 our connecting flight to Manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of 26 hours by the time we got home. BA made sure our travel experience was as miserable and inconvenient as possible. I have decided after many issues of late with BA that I can no longer be bothered with the hassle. If the flights are not delayed then they usually manage to lose my luggage. I have finally had enough and will use other carriers whenever I can.",0.5
1291,2015-10-30,,"the seat was roomy I recently got an unexpected upgrade to World Traveller Plus whilst on my way to New York. There was free cava before take-off and a random hot towel handed out. The seat was roomy and leg room was fantastic. Even more so because I was at the front of the World Traveller Plus cabin just after Club World, so there were no seats in front of me. Inflight entertainment was ok, but not as good as I was expecting. I did struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. I think now with early digital release of many films on things like i-Tunes, the days of being able to see really recent films on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end. As I was at the front of the cabin I had a screen that folded out of my armrest, which meant I was looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead, which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile. It was also annoying to stow away. The food was good for airline food. You get a superior meal in World Traveller Plus and it was pretty tasty and filling. The pre-landing snack wasn't up to much though. It was a dull sandwich, much like those that BA hand out on short-haul European flights. A real bonus about being in World Traveller Plus is that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit. This is useful when arriving in the US where immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. I ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue as I was so quick off the plane, which meant I was out through immigration pretty quickly. I think to pay for World Traveller Plus would be quite expensive for what you get in some respects (essentially a nicer meal and more leg room) but it was a nice treat from BA and If you were going on a super long haul flight I can definitely see the attraction.",0.1

Ground service at London/Heathrow Terminal 5 is smooth and no hassle. Check in and security was very fast and efficient. I particularly like BA's boarding procedure at Heathrow, very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight. Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches legroom compared to CX's 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seats. IFE had a few glitches but the FA's were happy to assist and worked perfectly throughout the flight. However, more movies, TV programmes and music options could be offered. Meals were mediocre. Drinks were served around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was either curry, vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still not as good as CX. Portions could be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options: pasta or chicken casserole, I went for the latter. Again, portions could be better.

The standby crew member (who happened to be a purser) in business class was chatty, friendly and pleasant to everyone. He did his best to make up for his colleagues major shortcomings! The original designated purser for the flight on the other hand was well .. he plonked the meal down in front of you without uttering one word. The only words he spoke to the entire 24 passengers in the club section were 'do you want it or not'. He put the roll basket in front of everyone's nose but still did not utter one word. It was bizarre - I've never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passengers whatever class they were flying! He couldn't even be polite to his colleague with just a 'pass me some cokes' and that was that.

Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we waited over an hour before we were informed, only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made, that our luggage was lost at Heathrow - along with 500 other bags. Things happen, and can be forgiven; it's what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. We were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. We were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. Since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through Scotland, we gave them the address of the B&B where we would be the following night, essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. We received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. They did not arrive. In the next seven days, I spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in India who were absolutely no help at all. The customer service phone line at BA was not being answered, and the supposed courier service phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of service as well. I emailed both the courier service and BA customer service and did not receive a response from either one. Still, the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. On the evening of the fifth day, it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line (in India) who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in Edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. The bags were continually listed as being out for delivery, but they never showed up. We were never contacted, and neither was the B&B where we had had them (supposedly) sent. On the morning of the sixth day, on yet another call to India, I stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that I was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. Then, in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the Edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there, that they had never been out for delivery at all. We would be in Tarbert on Harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. Seven days after our arrival in Edinburgh. During the seven days, we had to purchase clothes to wear. We missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with BA and the time spent shopping for clothes. When we made the return flight, we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. Finally, a month later, we have received a note of intended compensation from British Airways - for the amount of the clothing only. Not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn't have needed to buy or to check through, and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of British Airways. That's completely on them, and we should be reimbursed for the charges. One would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience, but nothing was offered.",0.9

BA also gives the option of pre-ordering your choice of main course online so although I did notice they ran out of choice towards the end of the service I had received my beef. I advise anyone in First/Business/World Traveller Plus to use this facility. World traveller Plus is definitely an 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines premium economy which is more a 'business minus'. So keep expectations in check. You get a bigger seat, pre take off drink, little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal. However, considering that I paid only £170 per sector on top of the usual World Traveller (economy) fare it was worth every penny in my eye. Would I pay a crazy supplement for this class of travel? No. But if the surcharge is minimal I'd highly recommend it.",0.2

My full refund offer came with a $50 cancellation fee and a $40 service fee. I have yet to accept the offer. We never cancelled her flight nor received anything that looks like service.

1298,2015-10-27,,"lot of money for little in return My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade.",0.1

Booze choice is okay. Quite why, in Italy of all places, a platter of mixed meats, cheeses and typical antipasti cannot be provided - probably costing about £50 a day, is a mystery. British Airways don't care. No airbridge so a trudge to the plane. It was an ex BMI A319 and given they ceased trading three years ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show British Airways branding and not BMI; very strange. Old BA Club Europe. Tired seats. FAs were fine. Food mediocre. Funny thing was the cabin smelt of a rather tasty ""meaty"" sort of meal. As we took off I was starving and full of optimism. All we got was a miserable afternoon tea; dried sandwiches, scones and jam. I compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonics. I asked myself, is this ""worth it"" - the extra for the product. What you get I suppose is a toilet for 12/14 passengers, compared with two toilets between 120 or so.  Wider seats (no extra legroom).  A meal over economy but not by much,  glasses to drink from rather than plastic beakers and a faster exit from the plane,  a few extra AVIOS points - that's it basically! Not a lot.

We filed a complaint, but so far (more than a month) heard nothing from them albeit several calls. Disgraceful attitude.

Advantage is that the seats are still 3-3-3 and not 3-4-3. Both flights on time. Outbound flight very full, cabin crew worked hard but without much enthusiasm. Meal was very poor, the so-called dinner was chicken in a slimy gravy. There was no sign of either fresh fruit or vegetables. Later a cardboard box was issued containing a chicken sandwich. Return flight food was even worse, but as departure was 1.30 am the initial effort, called a ""snack"", was again in a cardboard box, and contained nuts, dry biscuits and a couple of minibars of chocolate. Later in the flight ""breakfast"" was served. The choice was mixed grill with chicken or omelette. The mixed grill turned out to be an amorphous yellow mass-presumably pretending to be egg, with a round coin shaped structure which was so-called chicken and four potato discs. It was a disgrace and inedible. British Airways has to do something about its catering, it compares very poorly with other airlines. If the food is not worth eating then they should not serve it.",0.7

Next information will be given next morning at 09.00, which later was postponed until 14.30. Requests of rebookings were refused as the flight were not cancelled. They just said come to the airport early enough. British Airways failed to provide information about EU passanger's rights as it had to be requested separately. Lot of fellow passsengers were not aware of their rights. Next afternoon local grond handling company only had regular number of check-in desks open even there were two flights cheking-in at the same time. So only three desks open and they were not able to start checking us in but requesting us to step aside for the same day flight passengers. Great as we had only been waiting around 22hrs for our flights. Finally our flight got new departure time which was at 17.30, later to changed 18.00. At the gate departure time came and went and no announcement were made. Departure time were postponed until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new delay. When requesting some futher information it was said it's the same reason as yesterday but we had been given a written statement saying this aircraft had been fixed. At 18.30 still no announcement and passengers get anxious about mimimal information given by aviator. Then 20 min later British Airways cancels this flight.

My first question is does anybody from British Airways actually read these comments? If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in Toronto on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other bags. They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem - after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up on the Hotel Manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4 - not a problem normally. but it had cost £90.00 extra to book these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude.",0.3

Everything seemed normal until I reached the gate for boarding - the scanner at the final checkpoint reported ""not checked in"". After a 5 minute or so wait, I was allowed to board, but moved to a different seat (I was told this was the final one, but not given any explanation as to why). Once on the plane, I was asked to move to what turned out to be my original seat. I filled in BAs feedback form about this and asked what was going on, but they were apparently receiving a high volume of complaints and never responded. In the circumstances, I think I'll stick with more reliable airlines from now on. The flight itself was delayed by a 1/2 hour while they waited for ""more passengers"". The flight itself was uneventful, and the meals and service okay for economy. Having said that, the Boeing 747 is horribly outdated, and the IFE system repeatedly failed and had to be rebooted.",0.3
1323,2015-10-04,,"very disappointed in British Airways I'm not one for publishing reviews but following discussions of flight problems, have just heard of Skytrax. I have lost track of the numbers of flights I've taken over the years, on business in Europe and on holiday worldwide. With family in the US, regular flights have almost exclusively till now been with British Airways: some economy, some WTP, more recently in Business. Service, value etc has to now ranged from acceptable to good, occasionally excellent. Shame things seem to have changed. For our annual trip last December I booked my 7-year old daughter and myself on British Airways LHR to Chicago, returning from Washington Dulles to LHR. Both flights in Business Class. Booking process online reasonably good, with helpful assistance from a ""real person"" when there was a problem - which happened 3 times in the months before departure. No common sense used when flights are cancelled and ""suitable alternatives"" booked, when seats had been pre-purchased, when clearly travelling with a child. Check-in and departure were smooth. Travel in economy means that they feed children first. Travel in business and they serve children serve after the adults.  The ""child meal"" (when it eventually arrived) was a disgrace, I wouldn't feed it to an animal! Peas blackened, mash dried and crusty. Not surprisingly she didn't want it. Ended up eating my meal. Entertainment screen (essential for children and part of the treat of the journey) didn't work, so we swopped seats - so no entertainment screen for Mummy! Thank goodness I had my Kindle. No apologies from staff. More interested in the male business travellers. Return flight after Christmas from  Washington Dulles to LHR was slightly better. Evening meal available in lounge prior to boarding - providing you're an adult. Again nothing for children except some biscuits.

This is my 3rd time I have flown this route onboard one of the Boeing 747-400 and I must say British Airways have got to either fully upgrade their B747 fleet or retire the aircraft. The seats are far too cramped and not comfortable, the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several times as they stopped working or didn't work at all, the heat in the cabin was unbearable at times and very uncomfortable. The only plus points were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasn't too bad. I am aware that around 18 Boeing 747's are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the B747 on the Phoenix route is not, and for me as the route I travel, causes me concern and has me wondering if I will travel with BA again.  Not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesn't mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move, seats that don't feel like they are going to cripple you, have an entertainment system that works and has a better selection of movies/tv shows/music.

The seats were narrow, lumpy and incredibly uncomfortable especially for a long haul journey. I thought initially that we were unlucky and got broken or faulty seats on our outward journey, but they were just as bad on the return journey. To add insult to injury, we'd selected and paid for seats of our preference, but when we got to the airport for our return journey we were told the seats were gone, and simply told we would have to apply for a refund. The worst aspect of the flight however, was the heat. The aircraft was oppressively hot and stuffy for hours on the way from Johannesburg to London. Many passengers complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning system appeared too old to regulate the temperature. Also the entertainment system had to be switched off and rebooted several times because many passengers' consoles were not working. There were passengers who had to do without entertainment for the entire 10 hour flight. These aircraft are not fit for flying and should have been retired a decade ago. Pity the poor crew who have to work on these clapped-out aircraft every day. We've been travelling to South Africa several times a year for the past decade and this was our first time travelling with British Airways. Clearly it will also be our last.

A snack and drinks were served on both legs. This time the sandwich consisted of a mini pastrami and cheese sandwich and a mini black currant bun. Edible, but not BA´s best sandwich offering.  Additional drinks were served on request. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. While the seat are slightly better than the Recaro slim seats, I miss the older more comfortable seats with better leg room. I did not really realize that BA has changed the rules recently and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). Also, if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR75 at the airport or EUR35 on line.  The final fare with BA can be substantially higher than the initial price quote - the additional charges are displayed during the booking process and if one commits to checking luggage during the booking process, the charges are lower. With the exception of a free drink and sandwich, British Airways Economy product is now pretty much a low-cost airline product. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checking luggage. While VIE-LHR was on time, the return LHR-VIE leg was delayed for one hour. After a timely boarding the full plane was waiting for the departure, but then the flight deck announced that they are waiting for some cargo to be loaded and they missed their assigned slot, which meant waiting an hour for a new slot. So, basically BA inconvenienced a whole plane of passengers to load some delayed cargo. Flying with hand baggage only, I used web check-in for both flights which worked fine. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE. The Lounge as such is acceptable (small and mostly packed), but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. The selection seems to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE. BA Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 a comfortable oasis amid a busy airport and food and drinks selection was better than VIE. Wine selection was nice. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE, which I consider a huge benefit over using T5, which tends to be a mess for passengers. While I stopped flying British Airways Business in Europe they BA changed Business seating to Economy seats with no additional legroom, I see no valid reason to pay any surcharge for this product, but I still consider BA one of the better options for Economy flights in Europe. However their new low-cost airline concept also means that the times when I was willing to pay higher prices just for flying with BA over easyJet or Austrian on this route are unfortunately over.",0.1

Meal service with two salads and some nice bread along with a decent main. Small snack before landing - I always feel that a bigger option should be provided on a 7 hour flight, since it is too small for you not to have to eat again when you arrive. IFE had a good selection and worked fine. I like the way they have set out the Club World cabin - it is a bit different and although crowded it is calm and professional.

The meal service has been much debated, and is served (rather pushed at you) on a cheap economy style format, and quality is on a par with JAL economy class I used in August.

Ordinarily I don't like those seats as there's nowhere to put your things when the plane takes off, but I was in the middle and the three seats between me and the man in the other aisle seat in my row were empty (presumably this is why I was moved to this seat, as it was ""better""), so I just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine.

We were sat next to a group of drunken passengers who were loud and were continued to be served drinks throughout. I am sure this didn't make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised - running out of drinks etc. As we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choices by the time we were offered food - the crew were not really interested. When asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to us and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused. The food was poor quality, dry hard chicken with very little flavour. Breakfast was an egg mayonnaise roll and again there was no alternative.

The check-in person said they would try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate, but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay. In this case needless to say our separate seating remained separate. I wouldn't take the trouble to record this here except that I have felt irritated for the last few flights I've done with British Airways, with poor food, in-flight entertainment screens that work intermittently, faulty headphones, or being seated so that the only screen available is the other side of the business class dividing curtain which was drawn half way through the film. I've preferred British Airways on the basis that some of the budget operators charge you the same by the time you add their various extra charges.

Last few times I've flown British Airways, I'd been forced to consider BA as a discount airline that doesn't deserve its 4 star rating, and I was not looking forward to this flight. We had awful seats at the back of a very full plane so asked at bag drop about upgrades. Paid £230 each to go up to WTP (a bargain when added to the price we paid for our seats in coach) and it was worth it! Does anyone know why we check in online or go to a self-serve kiost but still have to go to bag drop to pretty much go through the check in process again? Boarding went as usual, smiley welcome aboard and to our seats. This aircraft had WTP immediately behind First. Good leg room, comfortable seat, small cabin of its own. A small amenity pack is provided, although most of the stuff in it is inferior and hardly worth having. Only one FA worked our cabin but he was friendly and efficient and the lack of more staff was not noticable. Drinks trolley and lunch menus then food served. Lunch with 2 options, china plates, real cutlery, napkins etc.  Food was very good, even though only one option left by time we were served. Had beef, which was tasty and tender and well presented. A snack box was passed out a few hours later and dinner served 2 hours before landing. Interestingly, dinner was from economy. Foil dish, plastic cutlery, paper napkins. Given the price of WTP ticket, would have expected better then that.  Only one juice/water round but FAs were in the galley and happy to get whatever you wanted (until we drank tham out of bubbles!). Being an older plane, the IFE was ancient with a very small screen that had grid lines showing and a barely adequate movie selection. Noise cancelling headset was not the best and hurt my ears. IFE was only a minor irritation, as flight was scheduled 10 hours 45 and I was more interested in comfort, which WTP provided. Only real gripe is the tray table. It folds out of the seat arm as a drinks tray, then unfolds to a full tray. Problem is, drinks slide off when in small mode and you have to brace the full tray on your knees to stop your dinner sliding off. British Airways is relying on its past reputation rather than providing a good product these days and I avoid them if I can because of that. I didn't think I would be saying this but I enjoyed this flight and it was probably the best BA flight I've had. A shame then that I will still avoid British Airways if I can.",0.9

They say we need to take it up with Vueling, their sister company - call Vueling and are told it is a British Airways issue. None of them will take responsibility for changing our flight times without asking. It's now too late to get an alternative flight at a reasonable price, so have to return at a stupid time in the morning which has ruined our anniversary weekend break. No compensation or anything.

It is a shame that British Airways has fallen prey to greed and instead of upgrading its business product, it has introduced a very poor product on Club Europe. Food was poor and so was the inflight service. If the person in front reclines, it is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it. I will never fly British Airways Club Europe again.",0.1

Both flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule and the fare was competitive. Check-in and bag delivery was fine at all 3 airports. The aircraft interiors were shabby at best, seats uncomfortable, IFE hopeless, food awful. Cabin crew were mixed, one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duties in a perfunctory way. One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly. From the good days of quality service in the 1980's, British Airways have gradually deteriorated into a third-class carrier and can never hope to compete on customer service with the airlines from the Middle and Far East. What a shame.",0.2

The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote ""her guests"" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers. The old British Airways corporate slogan ""The Worlds Favourite Airline"" are long gone. For our next flight to South Africa or elsewhere, I think it will be back to KLM for us.",0.3

I will never fly British Airways again if I can avoid it. I arrived on time and it felt like a safe journey, but everything from check in, to the seat configuration and comfort (and cleanliness), the food and the entertainment system were so far away from the competition. The cabin crew were snooty on the A380 out of LHR - in this example I was a silent observer to several unacceptable customer service responses. The only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the staff at the Washington Dulles lounge, the rest of BA could learn a lot in there.

Okay, this was British Airways First class, but not such a huge deal, he offered it to me in a Wine glass instead not a big problem.  20 minutes later he returned and said he couldn't serve me a Vodla Martini as there was no Martini on the plane.  Then came the 'Dine as you please' meal option. I asked for my dinner to be served 2 hours into the flight, I was asked my choice and chose the Steak - to be told there was no Steak left.

It was not. Instead of decent seat conditions expected for a 11 hours duration flight, I found seats that barely accommodate a normal person (not so tall, not overweight) and completely unable to have a decent meal during the flight. The economy class of British Airways can be defined as simply terrible. Do not waste your money by paying a bit more believing you will find comfort in an intercontinental flight flying economy class with British Airways.

Problem is how inconsistent British Airways is in regard to baggage allowed in the cabin. Some people have two or three big bags when I thought only one was allowed. So this then puts pressure on passengers with just one to put in the lockers with the crew trying to get them to put the bag by their feet. Why should they? I carry less on the plane to be able to have foot space - why should I give that up when someone else brings on more bags. This needs to be looked at.

1356,2015-09-07,,"space in economy is abysmal Las Vegas to London Heathrow with British Airways. What we were expecting and what we got are two separate things.  We boarded the aircraft on time, and were greeted at the doorway, but once inside, the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting - no help anywhere! We settled into our seats, which were narrow and very cramped, and the heat in the cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. The service commenced once the flight was underway and free drinks were offered, and if you fancied a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. The meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given - or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. This was changed when it was brought to the attention the of the crew, and looking back I think she would have been better with the wrong choice that was given, and suffered the consequences as it looked unappetising, bland and who knows what it was. No vegetables, no meat. The rest of the meals were served (or should I say thrown at us) offering pasta or chicken. The attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. For the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. One  of the screens in the seatback wasn't working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin crew being told - why aren't these things checked prior to boarding? The space you get in economy is abysmal, the person in front of me put his seat back and was nearly lying on me, the leg room is shocking and the seats uncomfortable. My son couldn't eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up as he couldn't see it. The cabin crew should make an announcement when meals are served for passengers to upright the seats out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when they're serving meals - no they don't, as it would be too much of an effort for them. The only good thing about the flight was arriving early so we could get off it. Would we fly British Airways again - on this experience no, you would have more room in a tin of sardines! British Airways need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service to everybody on the flight - not just the passengers in the posh seats, and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course.",0.6

On the return flight, I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern, the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didn't work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later (battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside).

The usual food choice of ""pasta or chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue.

This aircraft is old and decrepit and was built in the 80s, it should have been retired long ago. A quick Google search shows that this aircraft makes up the majority of BA's longhaul fleet. The seats are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you. I am 5ft 8 and weigh 70kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me. Everything is old and looks it too. Even the staff. The seats are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath. In fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature Tropicana bottle I had put the seat pocket. Even the safety animation video looks like it was made as a school IT project by 11 year olds. Staff are cold and unfriendly, it would seem that their contracts forbid smiling of any kind. The inflight entertainment screens are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixels, it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed. They are running on brand image only and even then there's only fumes left in tank. Do not fly BA at least until they seriously upgrade their fleet.",0.1

Two cups of tea and a muesli bar was ample. My wife and I were travelling on different itineraries with British Airways and this was one flight we shared. I asked 3 times for the agent to link the booking, which she did. BA computer did not perform properly so we were seated apart.

This was part of a ""trip of a lifetime"" we had planned to the UK. We have never flown business class, so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. I am not sure if it was worth it at all! Toronto to London was an overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Ease of booking online was very good, Customer Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a language barrier!). Check in at Toronto was average, nothing above check in at any other counter. Lounge at Toronto very good, great food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats. Comfortable but lacking any type of space (the lie flat bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto pilot - not rude but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5) to Toronto was not really any better. The business class lounge at Heathrow was not good. Lousy food, looks very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were average .I would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after security) to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate (especially if it is in the B or C sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same seat on the return trip, so again average. Food, service etc all average. Overall, we were not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another airline).

Upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. With little information given as to why. When we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for himself. What amused me was that the captain came on over the PA and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. Safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. The captain kept us informed as best he could, the cabin crew showed no effort at all. They showed no will to actually be there, they didn't check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39°C outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. Once we took off the service seemed rushed, I wasn't able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back, no so much a pitiful Ham and Cheese bun thing and a drink. There was no personal touch to it. As we were approaching Heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley (we were in the back row) was the two crew complaining about their hours.

Resulted in me being stranded at Heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. I had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled 'heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos'.

The flight attendants (one in particular) who served from BAH to LHR were very good. It was a Sleeper-Service, so the dinner menu was minimal, but breakfast didn't compensate well for that either. Cost-cutting was evident here. Thankfully, I didn't have to jump over anyone to access the aisle as many adjacent seats were empty.

The positive in all this was being put up in a hotel. Again - lack of communication. I was never contacted directly - people in the group were updated by BA on twitter. great if you have internet/twitter.  Despite putting in a claim from BA for flight delay I have not yet had a response from a human being. Not sure re star ratings - this site does not appear to let me put a Zero star rating.",0.5
1381,2015-08-14,,"British Airways customer review Flight was picked because it got us from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Newcastle, UK in a reasonable amount of time. What BA failed to inform anyone was that despite advertising the flight from RUH to LHR as landing at 5.25am BST at LHR is that planes cannot land at LHR before 6am. So once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the Newcastle flight. We made it and got to Newcastle only to find that our two suitcases were there but my golf bag which I had paid for did not make that flight. It did make the next flight to Newcastle but I had already had to set off to make an appointment some 170 miles from Newcastle. It took 3 days for my golf bag to arrive at where I was staying. Not one word of apology from BA. The seats on the flights were ok, service of crew satisfactory, the headsets didn't work from RUH to LHR and I tried three sets. Best part was the hot bacon sandwich between LHR and NCL.",0.4
1382,2015-08-14,,"British Airways customer review I have been a long time supporter of BA, but they have successfully managed to degrade the economy product to such an appalling level that I suspect that US based carriers now offer a better product. From ridiculously expensive fees to book seats in advance, to child-sized low quality meals on board, to planes on our route that only offer the dense 3-3-3 configuration, and new policies limiting the amount of Avios you can earn with economy tickets, I have had enough. My partner and I left both the transatlantic flight to LHR from PHL, as well as the LHR to TXL flight absolutely starving. A very sad state of affairs for BA.",0.1

On our way out to Rome, we were told that the plane had to be changed, so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it I thought well, OK, maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes so no hot meals available. However, on our return, not only did we have an hour delay (still not sure why that happened, we were traveling with a 1 year old baby, so it was quite stressful just waiting around), but on our flight our ""meal"" was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce, they said chicken was in it, but I didn't have any in mine. That was it, no hot drink either, the drinks trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink, or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling. I'm not a fussy person, but I thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot, I didn't have time to eat anything at the airport, and arrived home at midnight, I was starving.",0.2
1384,2015-08-12,,British Airways customer review Travelled on August 8th when there was a power outage at London Heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. Finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with BA again.,0.1

Aircraft B777 full flight, probably around 100 business class passengers so too many to know by name and no effort was made by cabin crew. Seats cramped (as expected). Did not eat on board as had dined in the lounge. A few drinks, part of a film then tried to get some sleep on the 7 hour flight. Landed earlier then expected but then had to wait half hour for luggage . Overall Cabin Crew very good, aircraft clean.

We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry.

I found the seats to be very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen was almost in my face. She refused to put it back when we asked politely. She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone, then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like tea and if all was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy. Previously I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline.

My best experience recently was flying the to Las Vegas on an ageing B747, but this was overcome by the decision to offer us the option of sitting in the ""Old"" First Cabin, which my wife and I took full advantage of and was very comfortable, quiet and private. We did the same on the way back, but because of an aircraft change we found ourselves flying in a refurbished New First which was the icing on the cake (all of this for just £2000 each in the BA sale). This type of service can also be repeated on short haul with excellent food for an airline. My only gripes are the use of tiny A319's on the Paphos route which is too small a plane for such a long route and I'm not a big fan of the decision to reduce legroom in the new Club Europe, however the exclusion of the middle seat does give enough room for you legs. Having flown with Qantas and Emirates in Y Class recently I genuinely don't believe they are much further ahead of BA, my A380 experience on Qantas was distinctly ordinary for a premium product.",0.9

However, these planes are rather old and neither my seat nor the one next to me had a working headphone jack. British Airways is a standard airline, but not as good as other major scheduled airlines.

I booked a flight to Florence through BA website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that I was flying with Vueling. Never heard of them. To cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours, nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally got there, one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left Italy yet. We informed the ground staff. They did not day a thing. After half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. I headed straight back the the terminal and sought a British Airways rep to try and get an answer, firstly because that is who I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no representation at the airport. I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't help. I explained the situation again and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer Service Representative' walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him. He looked at me as if I had 2 heads and in the end walked away after calling me an 'ar----le'. 100% true, in the middle of Gatwick North Terminal. My wife and 6 week old child were themselves waiting at Florence 4 hours for me. We were told Vueling were going to try and get us out the following day. But no guarantees. I booked another flight with British Airways to get to my family, and British Airways have offered nothing, not even an apology. Vueling will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedures. British Airways should be ashamed of what they have become.",0.7

British Airways staff are friendly and professional but why has there been such a drastic fall in standards? They try to save money by not serving you napkins with the drink. And the drinks come in plastic cups that could have been more stylish. Little things like these tell a lot about an airline. But at least drinks and snacks were free.,0.1

1394,2015-08-06,,"British Airways customer review From the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a 24 hour flight, I am thoroughly disappointed with British Airways. My husband and I travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from London to Sydney together. I phoned British Airways 3 days before my flight from London to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. I was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. However if I wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. I was not giving this money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so I refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. When online check in opened my husband and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. This woman did not even work for British Airways but was the most helpful. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. The cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in Economy. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane). I will only be flying with Emirates or Singapore Airlines in the future who know how to look after their passengers.",0.1
1395,2015-08-04,,"British Airways customer review I am a Silver Card Holder, work in aviation and fly around 3-4 times a week. Up to 2 months ago I was loyal to BA as it is an 'English Airline with English Values' but this loyalty was unfounded. My main issue now with BA is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. On frequent trips to Dubai with BA on a 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that BA has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. The seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. The arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. The inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. On short haul flights, in business (LHR-MUN), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. The seats are lightweight. Uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room, the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without AC on. My worst experience was trying to fly back to Munich from London. It was an old A320. As we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. On landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. This I feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100 + passengers off as the last flight to London departed. We then had to stand around for 2 Hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. Next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. I would not recommend BA at present, even the new A380 I flew on to LA had so many faults and badly thought through. I will miss the easy access of Terminal 5 and lounges that I earned through loyalty as many other customers do. However the age, quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care has lost me as a customer.",0.1

This flight was fairly full , departed on time and check in was very quick. In my opinion the 747 fleet of BA needs either replacement of extensive refurbishment, these aircraft are all old and look it in the interior. The seats were past their prime and quite uncomfortable. The food offering was very poor, no fresh items either at dinner or for breakfast. Staff were OK, punctuality was good and baggage delivery although not fast was acceptable. Inflight entertainment was good but the TV screens are from a previous age with quite poor quality",0.2

We were handed tickets for an American Airlines flight from a different O'Hare terminal and told ""you have to go now"". The terminal was in chaos and travelling from the international terminal to terminal three took one hour. Getting boarding passes and going again through security was another hour or so but the flight was delayed and left two hours late. Flight was very mediocre and not what I had paid for with BA.

Once onboard I discoverd that the interior was worn and the seats very uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment or the VOD (video on demand) system apeared to be VHS and was broken for my seat, one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minutes. The screen was very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the in-flight entertainment was more tiring than not watching it. The food was average but seemed to match the aircraft as it was dull and tasteless. As this was an overnight flight I expected to be able to get somewhat more than a 30 min nap which was interupted, any sleep was not possible due to the fact that there was 5 infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least 3 were shrieking at any given time. The Boeing 777 should not be still used on long haul flights as it does not live up to the standards of BA's Airbus A380's or Boeing 747 flights.

1400,2015-07-28,,"British Airways customer review I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything.",0.5
1401,2015-07-27,,"British Airways customer review This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level.

It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition.

1403,2015-07-27,,"British Airways customer review I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing.",1.0

Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served.

WC clean with paper towels. Adequate IFE. The difference between older crew on prior sectors and young cabin crew on this flight was stark. They were polite and totally wooden. On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil. Club World is like a stretched Economy with a Business Class fare.",0.5

Didn't like the seat much, B777 the seat is closer to the windows then the A800 which is more preferable for me. Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic.

We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380.",0.6

Seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food superb, best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for £65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again.",0.8

The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful. Others are downright rude (as one was on this flight) Overall, BA can be great, but sometimes not so much.",0.2

The seat was comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the windows was a great help too.

I have never seen that on any of the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out.

Lounge was crammed and noisy pre-flight. I joined Star Alliance as a Gold Member so at least got to see the Miles and Smiles lounge. BA, look around don't rest on last century's efforts. I've flown BA First but just wouldn't any more. Responding to Skytrax reviews may just help increase profits.

Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow selection at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks etc) extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector. If they continue their money-grabbing policy I will definitely and happily give more of my business to Aer Lingus and Cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows.",0.5

The passenger next to me was repeatedly woken as food was handed over or spilt on him. After the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. Only one bottle of water all flight. The food was tasteless, overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiments reminded me of fast food chain. At the price this is the worst product in the skies. Seat was broken and IFE clunky.

It's been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. My colleague had the same. Officious and uncalled for.

As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31"", BA has lost my future business.",0.5

Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up.

Whilst the food was good it had to be changed as the first offering was cold. Inflight crew were pleasant and efficient. Upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passengers.",0.1
1453,2015-06-07,,British Airways customer review I flew from Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda in First. The Concorde Lounge at Heathrow was quite good though I was surprised by how little choice there was when it came to food. The seat on the new First was good. The service was all right. The food on board was poor as it has been each time I've flown First over the years. To find something edible I had to retreat to the snack bar in business. I was particularly disappointed because BA is still my first choice for economy and it is fine in business apart from the bizarre seating configuration.,0.4
1454,2015-06-06,,British Airways customer review HER-LGW. Our return flight confirmed our view that Club Europe is a waste of money on this new route. HER is infamous as a relic of the 70s and BA have done nothing to improve that. Check-in was interminable despite a Club Europe desk. There was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. No lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. Not surprisingly there was no priority boarding. Our seats 2D and 2E are the only decent seats in the new Club Europe. Service on board was adequate. LGW was the usual nightmare taking 45 minutes to crawl through the boarder control fiasco. We certainly wouldn't want to repeat our BA experience to and from HER.,0.3
1455,2015-06-06,,British Airways customer review I'm very disappointed with my BA flight as it was very poor. I was traveling from GLA Glasgow-LCA Larnaca via LHR London. On my first flight my tray table fell on it hinges. They did gives a full breakfast though. Then on the second flight the middles of the seat were full of dust and gum. Secondly the television on the 767 was broken. Finally on a 5 and a half hour flight they gave us a little chicken or vegetable wrap with a choc pud.,0.2
1456,2015-06-06,,British Airways customer review BA006 19th May 2015. Awful premium economy service - bad old cabin with faulty inflight entertainment and they even split my wife and I up when travelling back from Japan - how is that acceptable?,0.4
1457,2015-06-04,,British Airways customer review Flew Eurotraveller Heathrow to Athens and back. Both flights only slightly delayed in departing crew attentive on both sectors and being a band 4 flight hot meals provided although edible the meat on the Athens to Heathrow was indeterminable. Cabin was fairly clean on both flights however did find a boarding card from 24 hours previous in my seat pocket. Traveled with a 6 month old baby and at Heathrow and on board was looked after my only criticism which is not really BA's fault was the check in agent at Athens (swissport) was hesitant about letting our pushchair through to the gate despite my insistence this had come from London with us and hadn't been an issue then!,0.1
1458,2015-06-04,,British Airways customer review Flew from Heathrow to San Francisco on May 1st with BA. What a disappointment! I had to pay over £120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. Then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. Our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was OK typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. Four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey! Don't they stock up before picking up the next passengers? Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. Before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues. Would I fly BA again certainly not long haul although unfortunately I have to return to Heathrow with them from Boston today.,0.7
1459,2015-06-01,,British Airways customer review Flew to Tampa from Gatwick on the 12/5/15 return flight on the 25/5/15. Had flown with BA on several occasions to Mauritius. Can't believe despite the number of complaints BA received nothing has changed regarding the food the service. Admittedly some of crew are good but some of them makes you wonder why did they choose such career. BA seriously need to review the customer care they provide. Dinner overcooked frozen rolls with a cereal bar for breakfast - really tasted better food on cheaper airline. Come on BA listen to your customer and improve your service. Very disappointed with BA.,0.4
1460,2015-05-31,,British Airways customer review Sadly flying British Airways is no longer about a great experience - it is a seat on a flight which you pay a lot of money for. We had a number of issues that we tried to get resolved via Customer Services but were told they couldn't do anything until our journey had ended? We were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address our issues during our journey. BA staff at Heathrow told us the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage (causing big issues) the plane was overly hot on both legs of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flights this is a known problem on these older planes. The breakfast on our return flight wasn't fit for consumption - an ice cold hard croissant after 7 hours of no food? Really poor service and even worse customer services.,0.5
1461,2015-05-31,,British Airways customer review I treated myself to Premium Economy on my PEK-LHR flight BA38 because it was only an extra £120 and I had been on holiday to North Korea and wanted a bit of luxury. I was impressed with the legroom in the bulkhead seat and the PE cabin was not very full. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and the food was good however it seemed to be the same as the Economy food just with a fancy menu card. I was impressed with the seat recline and the footrest and I got a lot of sleep even though it was a daytime flight. The IFE malfunctioned for the first half of the flight which seems a common occurrence on BA 747s. Staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.,0.1
1462,2015-05-31,,British Airways customer review I flew LHR-PEK for a holiday on a 747-400. The plane was not that busy and the seat next to me was free which was great. The plane was clean and my seat was reasonably comfortable. The IFE had a good selection although the small screens on the 747 now look out of date. The meal was fine for economy class and the staff were polite and attentive.,0.8
1463,2015-05-31,,British Airways customer review First off this particular flight from EWR to LHR and back was advertised as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The actual jet was a 777 much less comfortable. The flight going to London was 3 hours delayed coming into EWR something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in Boston MA. In fact they had not allocated a crew. Coming home my pre-paid seats were changed in premium economy to seats next to W'C's so I had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight. I was also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email was followed up with one that stated that the first one was sent in error. Fact: I did get back to the USA. Reality: BA no more - never again. The problem with BA is not their cabin crews who are quite nice. The problem is that their Customer service is a joke. Cannot recommend this airline.,0.7
1464,2015-05-29,,British Airways customer review LHR-ATL-LHR. Out 3rd May. Back 12th May. First both ways. Outstanding experience. Check-in and security straight through.

1466,2015-05-28,,British Airways customer review LGW-HER. A320 on one of BA's new tourist-orientated routes. Sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny-pinching 'new' Club Europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. If this is the way BA are going it doesn't make sense to pay the extra. They really should think again about their premium service.,0.9
1467,2015-05-28,,British Airways customer review Gatwick to Florida return Flight out was quite good with an attentive crew 3 choices of meals found the seatback TV screen very small and selection of movies and audio choice was poor legroom could be a lot better too and I feel that BA need to update their B777 on this route. Return flight was delayed two hours but was informed by the airline by text and email on check-in a $9 vouches was given to buy drinks or a snack i found the food on the return flight very poor with only chicken or pasta available and the breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and jam and a raisin bar that was virtually indelible I would consider flying BA to Florida again if their prices are comparable to other carriers.,0.3
1468,2015-05-27,,British Airways customer review LGW-CUN-LGW. Husband and I had middle seats both outbound and return. We found seats comfortable for seating and sleeping. Crew on outbound were a lot more efficient and friendlier than the inbound crew where the service was a bit haphazard and one particular crew member who was a few years older than the others was rather offhand and didn't smile much at all. Outboard there were empty seats all around us so we did not have to sit face to face with strangers or climb over anyone when leaving our seats but cabin was quite full inboard so we did not enjoy the flight as much. The Club World cabin is definitely cramped compared with other business class cabins and I do not know what BA were thinking when they decided to pack in so many seats and in such a way as to make it very awkward for less mobile passengers to exit their seats. Storage space is lacking around the seats due to BA trying to fit too many passengers into too small a space. I would not say I would not travel Club World with BA again but would look at alternative airlines with different cabin layouts first.,0.7
1469,2015-05-27,,British Airways customer review Gatwick-Naples returning Barcelona-Gatwick. Excellent flights as usual. Especially loved the stylish and comfortable interiors of the refitted A319 on the Naples run. Both flights left late but it didn't seem to seriously affect arrival time. Only complaint is the food/drinks service sandwich is not to my taste and I now refuse them - but other passengers seem pleased. Should offer an alternative such as crisps or nuts to go with wine.,0.7
1470,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review BA seem to be trying harder ground customer service much more friendly professional and efficient. T5 helps as it is a great terminal. Flew premium economy LHR to Denver flight sold out so got upgraded to Prem Economy. Positives : Small cabin between 1st class and Business makes it very exclusive and quiet (747 config 1) with no through traffic of other passengers. Upgraded service - welcome drink newspaper hot towel menu noise cancelling headphones upgraded blanket and much better food than economy (steak) bread selection etc. One flight attendant for the whole cabin but he was super efficient. Flight Attendant was excellent - friendly professional with none of the BA attitude that some have. Toilet just for premium economy. Negatives: 747 aircraft is old and you can feel that. Inflight entertainment is ancient small screen limited selection in both video and music Seat space and functionality good but not Air NZ. Toilet hygiene remains BA achilles heel - they just don't keep them clean vs. Asian airlines. This product is much improved from previous times I have taken it.,0.5
1471,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review Madrid-London City return. Excellent experience. Flights on time in fact 25 minutes early into LCY and arrival and departure procedures at both MAD and LCY fast and efficient. The Velazquez Lounge at MAD T4 is extremely comfortable and well-appointed with a good range of food and drink. Flight on a newish Embraer aircraft clean comfortable and spacious. Outstanding service from the two friendly English and Spanish speaking cabin crew. Full English breakfast with champagne and orange juice on the outbound and a nice chicken dinner with good wines on the return.,0.8
1472,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review Our flight on economy long distance from the Austin to Heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class. A huge disappointment.,1.0
1473,2015-05-20,,"British Airways customer review BA 138 13/5/2015. BA 273 13/5/2015. Just completed my first BA Flight in Club World. The experience can be summed up in a single word - ""pathetic"". The flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". The crew was totally indifferent. The light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge. Will never travel BA again.",0.1
1474,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review LGW - Antigua - LGW. Easy check in at the Club World desk and then quickly through security etc. Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. The return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference. Overall another good experience with BA bar the few issues that I have mentioned.,0.1
1475,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review Over the last couple of years I have travelled to China by Emirates KLM Virgin Atlantic and BA. The next time I travel BA will be my last choice. I got the impression from the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity. Their lounges are basic and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. If you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.,0.7
1476,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review Travelled from Heathrow to Washington in April on one of the new A380 planes. Extremely impressed with the plane even in economy the seats are quite spacious and the storage buckets at the side of the seat are a big plus. The service on board was good and the meals were pretty good. The plane arrived exactly on time too! All in all one of the best flights I've had.,0.2
1477,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review LHR to Istanbul - excellent service on the outbound flight on what was a very busy flight. Cabin crew worked very hard and consistently.

1478,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review Brilliant service from the cabin crew and Captain/First Officer on this much delayed Lisbon-LHR flight. BA have questions to answer - another Lisbon-LHR flight which was heavily delayed (this happens regularly) another BA flight from Lisbon with a remote boarding location and poor management prior to boarding. Our two hour delay - all after we had boarded - was handled brilliantly by the crew with regular communication refreshments and as jovial atmosphere as was possible. But BA must face up to the astonishingly poor lounge in Lisbon the poor management of boarding and a limp response to questions.,0.8
1479,2015-05-20,,British Airways customer review Business class. Scheduled to fly from Rome to Gatwick on 7 May on BA2543. The day that the fire broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome for the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went. So well down BA for what I know for others turned out to be a nightmare.,0.6
1480,2015-05-12,,British Airways customer review LHR-EZE business class on board B777. Tired old cabin old IFE system. Business class seat layout cramped and uncomfortable with forward and rear facing seats. However cabin crew deserve praise for their excellent attention.,0.5
1481,2015-05-11,,British Airways customer review Pisa-LGW. Lounge at Pisa is a shared set up and rather nice. Spacious and colourful. Comfortable seats. Much better than hanging around the terminal. We have used it a few times. Plenty of booze. Mediocre snacks. No food. Checked in online. Baggage drop off. No problems. Plane was parked on the tarmac. Had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish I wasn't going home). This is very annoying - because the whole point over flying BA instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the Irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. This has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (More BA cuts I wonder) Plane was a newish A319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. All clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. Seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. Afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed I happily drank three Gin and T's. FA's very pleasant and friendly. Even offered me a 4th G&T which I declined. All in all a good experience. (seats could be much better though). Landed ahead of schedule.,0.7
1482,2015-05-11,,British Airways customer review I flew from Heathrow to Istanbul on BA on their 767 the crew in Club Europe were very accommodating in their service. From start to finish of the flight they ensured that all passengers in Club Europe received the upmost service. Although the 767 is starting to show some age I prefer this version of the Club Europe seats compared to the new configuration which is being rolled out on their Airbuses. At least the seats on the 767 are comfortable & there is plenty of space between the rows compared the the new version which has the same pitch as economy. The catering was good with a great choice of meals to select from the service was speedy and accommodating too with their drinks etc..,0.9

Good selection of food and drinks and a very relaxing start to our flight. Boarding smooth and both of us were escorted to our seats 2E/F which are 2 together in the middle of the cabin. Cabin crew on both sides were excellent and couldn't do enough to make our flight comfortable. Seat very good and food good quality with a wide selection of drinks available. Flight passed very quickly and being first off plane meant we were first at US immigration although there was no queues so through within 5 minutes and our bags were first off. Excellent flight.,1.0

The meal was very good indeed with a great choice of meals to choose from. Throughout the flight the crew were very professional and quick to serve the meal and to clear away the meal items too. Although a 767 which was showing some signs of age I much prefer this aircraft with the old style Club Europe seats compared to the new Club Europe which has been rolled out by BA and which no one likes. A wonderful flight and great service what more could I ask from a great crew all that I do ask is keep the 767 & go back to the old Club Europe.,1.0

Boarding smooth greeted by friendly cabin crew captain apologised for the delay. Offered hot towels and champagne and crisps or nuts. Short but nice flight. Landed with a small delay. DFW-LHR: First class lounge in DFW is very basic and far from boarding gate. Boarding again was very smooth with waiting flight crew greeting you by name and guiding to your seat. Champagne was offered before you could take place in your seat. This first class travel was again a more than excellent flight. Also this time there was a technical issue but the captain informed us about every step excused several times for the delay again when landing in London with a delay of more than an hour. Cabin crew gives you the feeling you are the only guest on board giving you private service on demand. LHR-BRU: Club Europe. Concorde room with online reserved Cabana and a tasteful breakfast. Private bathroom with shower gave me a new revival boost. Boarding yes again excellent in all ways short flight. Hot towels decent food and perfect service by a perfect crew.,0.9
1490,2015-04-30,,British Airways customer review Heathrow to Bilbao. This is one of BA's new routes (although they used to fly the route years ago on a B757) and we got our return flights for a bargain Â£74. BA's hand luggage only fares to Europe offer very good value and I wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul routes! The A319 flight left from Heathrow Terminal 1 which is closing in June but now looks and feels like a ghost town. There were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. As for the flight we had the usual BA chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seats are uncomfortable and certainly similar to Ryanair with hardly any space. I appreciate BA's offering of sandwiches on their short haul flights but do wonder whether passengers really need this service nowadays.,0.5

This time our flight was operated with an Airbus A320 with slim line seats that looked brand new. These were very comfortable for a short haul flight and the leg room sufficient. In-flight catering was excellent. Coffee was a bit weak but the sandwiches were delicious. This time cheese and ham doorstop with white bread. I expected good things after last years flat bread and was not disappointed. Cabin crew were very friendly and efficient as were the airport staff. Boarding process was fast and efficient and on both flights at arrival and destination the aircraft was at a jet bridge so no need to board a bus. Flights departed and arrived on time. Will definitely fly BA again.,0.8
1493,2015-04-26,,British Airways customer review Club Europe LHR-AMS. The boarding process was a joke we had to take the bus to our aircraft. In the boarding lounge they asked for all Club Europe and Gold and Silver to come forward and board the bus then they let all of the remaining passengers board the bus which made priority boarding a total joke. They should follow the same process when flights land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by Club Europe passengers at least when departing Club Europe passengers would enjoy their priority boarding. I understand there is a need for on time departures but BA really need to ensure that where priority boarding is taking place their Club Passenger receive it.,0.9

Very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. The good experience ended there. Punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule! Well marvellous not in my opinion. Having just flown around the world on another airline which was able to operate twelve out of thirteen flights either on time or ahead of schedule I have to say that I remain generally unimpressed.,0.2

IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again. The seat is a real let down.,1.0
1499,2015-04-23,,British Airways customer review 15th Aug 2014 flight BA0272. Me and my 3 friends flew from SAN to LHR then to IST. Our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be completed. I wonder what would happen if we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. When they gave us our tickets we saw that they put us all separately. They could not even manage to sit us together. When I was thinking how could this get worse we missed our LHR-IST flight and waited in a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. While a clerk was trying to complete our check-in for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passengers processes and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk was offering 800 dollars per person and free accommodation for volunteer passengers to fly on the next plane.,0.6
1500,2015-04-19,,British Airways customer review My experience on return BA flights to LHR to Tokyo Narita in April 2015 scores very low. I used to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the same journey on Business Class for the past 10 years so I have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. Conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the Business Class on Virgin was my impression. BA T5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and cheap decor. Selection of food and beverages is limited. In the end I got fed up so I left the lounge to get better food from Wetherspoons! Since I'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. On BA you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! Also if you are in the middle aisle on BA you are right next to a stranger which is awkward. BA gives out Elemis kits. Food: on BA there is a 'fixed' options. For the dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. Not both. Also not too different a menu from Economy class. BA's service felt extremely limited they don't know your names they just do the very minimum service. BA disappointed me.,0.5
1501,2015-04-19,,British Airways customer review My return flight from Heathrow to Bologna last week reminded me of how good BA is for short haul in economy. Even a two-hour delay because of technical problems on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view. The pilot kept us up to date on what was happening. The crew were charming. OK the snack of a sandwich on such flights is pretty basic but the whole experience is so much more civilized than on budget airlines.,0.2
1502,2015-04-19,,British Airways customer review Gatwick to Thessaloniki return. Outbound ok not fantastic but certainly not bad. However where BA scored was on the return. At check-in the clerk was all prepared for my wife and I even though we were on separate bookings including ready printed lounge passes with my guest pass stapled to her own. Maybe a little thing but it made a difference.,0.7
1503,2015-04-17,,"British Airways customer review 10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it.",0.7
1504,2015-04-17,,British Airways customer review Flew BA256 from Delhi to Heathrow - usual BA issues which have been repeated here many times. Firstly the First cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! The food - the food can only be described as truly awful! To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. I did not bother with desert! Afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. The cabin crew were good and pleasant however I was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. It would seem to me that BA are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. Surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but I am struggling to see any level of improvement (I take at least 1 first class international flight every year). Have flown BA for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. The lounge (not run by BA but used by BA) at Delhi was very good indeed.,0.3
1505,2015-04-17,,British Airways customer review 9 April 2015 BA 777 Business Class Seattle USA - Heathrow. Check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.,0.4
1506,2015-04-17,,British Airways customer review DEL-LHR BA 256. Seats 17AB downstairs in business class in B747-400 G-BNLY. The aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained. Her age was most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. I have become used to the clarity of modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. I have made several long haul flights with BA in Business Class recently and have decided that I don't like the standard BA model business class seat. There is nowhere to put small items like glasses pens landing cards and so on. There is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. There is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level. At the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat. It is not strong and so can not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. Clunky and peculiar to BA it is not a design feature that enhances the seat. Individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space. Thoughts about coffins come to mind. When the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit. Seat 17B was a poor choice. It is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. On the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded.,0.7
1507,2015-04-16,,British Airways customer review We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. We will never fly with BA again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.,0.6
1508,2015-04-16,,British Airways customer review Substandard food in Business Class (London to Mauritius) arbitrary upgrade policy - as we could not afford Bus Class on return flight booked Premium Economy we told that because we were Bus on way out we would get priority consideration on way back. Charging for Seat selection is a rip off was separated from my wife on way out!,0.3
1509,2015-04-14,,British Airways customer review BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.,0.4
1510,2015-04-10,,British Airways customer review LHR-JFK/IAD-LHR. Superb round trip (for a very fair price) in economy with BA. Flight out was an hour or so late taking off because of the weather but was excellent once we got going. Fairly creaky 747 but the IFE was fine (good film selection) and the free booze flowed throughout. Great curry on the food front. Return was the real highlight on a new A380 that had joined the fleet four weeks ago. Large TVs even bigger selection of films/TV shows/games and the usual good free food (shepherd's pie) and drink (red wine and beer). Comfy seats with plenty of leg room (and I'm over six foot). Service on both flights exemplary and I have to say that I think BA have become a really class act.,0.5
1511,2015-04-10,,British Airways customer review Flew 30th March 2015 LHR-YVR return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). Seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. Enjoyed it. But the IFE was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of British Airways- outdated movies with TV shows from 3 months before. Since we were flying on a Boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. One recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! Even though there were negatives flying outbound I have to say the return was great. I had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so I sat in the extra legroom seats. IFE was far better and due to having the window seat I was able to sleep for around 6 hours when I was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. Food had no flavour and was quite spicy (Lentil masala) but still edible. Although my experience on BA84 was very enjoyable I heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. He had flown with Cathay Pacific to Manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. One of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. Overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. To improve British Airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like Singapore Emirates Etihad Cathay Pacific and Qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from BA.,1.0
1512,2015-04-10,,British Airways customer review Heathrow to Istanbul flight BA0676 in club class. I should have guessed what I was going to get when I saw this service is operated on a Boeing 767. Business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy. No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion. On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 BA has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.,0.7
1513,2015-04-08,,British Airways customer review From Shanghai to London on 17 Mar. The whole trip was very good. The check in procedure was very quick. Boarding was finished very quickly.

I really can not expect more.,0.5
1514,2015-04-08,,British Airways customer review Flew Warsaw to Heathrow. Reasonable all round. Fairly nice sandwich and drinks. Crew were patient with some passengers who thought they were in an all inclusive hotel. Very busy flight. New seats are extremely cramped. Feels a bit Ryanair. Boarding a bit chaotic as didn't do by seat row. Baggage started coming off one carousel at Heathrow only to inexplicably move to a different one without warning or announcement.,0.9
1515,2015-04-08,,British Airways customer review I travelled from London to Jo'burg and back on the Airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. On the way out I was in Premium Economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. The return in Business was a different matter. I was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passenger's feet to vacate my seat. All this at a premium price. Shocking. The cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers' views on the cabin! Never again.,0.7
1516,2015-04-06,,British Airways customer review Return LHR-YVR Boeing 747-400. I had been advised to fly BA but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed with the return leg. My seat was double booked so they eventually got me one but the entertainment system was not working! When I asked about it she said it had not been working yesterday either. No other vacant seats in economy but there were loads in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with nothing. Definitely would not fly with them again.,0.2
1517,2015-04-06,,British Airways customer review I usually have very positive experiences when flying BA. This time travelling on 30/03/15 LCA-LGW the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers. It was a 4.5 hour flight and were served the meal within the first 20minutes with nothing to do for the next 4 hours. There was no inflight entertainment. The staff did not offer any hot drinks and when I walked all the way to the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if I wanted one I could go and get it from service area. The staff couldn't have looked any more disinterested in their passengers!,0.3
1518,2015-04-06,,British Airways customer review LGW-JER-LGW day trip on March 25 both flights in Economy morning flight on Airbus 319 evening flight back on a 737-400 still featuring the more comfortable old seats. Both flights on-time or early. Excellent service for this short domestic hop. A breakfast sandwich and drinks were served in the morning while crisps or biscuits and full bar service were offered on the evening flight back. FAs were excellent on both legs providing a good efficient and friendly service on these short flights. Flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for both legs which worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable which is good. BAs Terraces Lounge in LGW is fairly comfortable and spacious enough although very busy in the morning. Acceptable cold breakfast choices and porridge as the only hot alternative. Drink choices were plentiful and of good quality. BAs Terraces Lounge in JER was more basic but again comfortable. Again various good quality drink alternatives but just very limited food options (basic snacks such as crisps and hot soup). Overall an excellent domestic flight experience for Economy. Would be more than happy to do it again. (Oneworld Sapphire).,0.4

1520,2015-03-26,,British Airways customer review DEL-LHR-HAM in Business. The club world product feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to Air India which has modern flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. Old planes old crew old seats old IFE BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.,0.5
1521,2015-03-26,,British Airways customer review Day to trip to Hamburg booked the day before travel. Great value for money. Outbound flight was on refurbished A320.

1522,2015-03-26,,British Airways customer review I flew today from San Francisco to Heathrow Business Class and as always it's a delight flying with BA. Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment was OK and food was satisfactory. My only criticism is that on the outbound flight we were served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly 7 hours for a light snack before landing. As I did not want to 'raid the larder' and eat fattening foods I was left starving! I still find the overall experience with BA is far superior to any other airline.,0.9
1523,2015-03-25,,"British Airways customer review I have been a longstanding BA gold card holder and frequent business traveller. BA has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 6'4"" I could not sit without great discomfort. This shows complete contempt for BA's customers. I first encountered this on a round trip to Brussels. It will be Eurostar for me in the future and Air France for which I also gave a gold card on other short hauls. Is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than Easyjet offers?",1.0
1524,2015-03-25,,British Airways customer review LHR-LAX - A380 was excellent a breath of fresh air in comparison to the typical tired planes of BA. Mixed fleet crew very friendly and enthusiastic. Food onboard was excellent received my first choice and the club kitchen was stocked with a selection of delicious sweet and savoury snacks. The upper deck was excellent as it was very quiet and private with approx 20 seats in the forward section. Entertainment very good on a larger screen than found on 747/777. Cabin very clean and in general felt very fresh and new. The only gripe is still having to climb over the passenger seated in the aisle with the ying yang layout.,0.3
1525,2015-03-25,,British Airways customer review We flew from LHR to Brussels and back on a reward flight which was very pleasant even though it was a quick hop across the channel!

Business lounge at Brussels was very pleasant and is to be recommended.,0.9
1526,2015-03-25,,British Airways customer review GRU-LHR 15 March 2015. Returned to BA this last 3 flights solely due to Avios companion coupon but purchased this tkt. Bossy cabin crew in the like of BA as we remember its glory days. G&T always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles! Wine was good this flight. South America routes still dogged with ageing 747 as opposed to Lufthansa's modern or upgraded fleet. Outbound from LHR my TV didn't work but they did credit me 3000 avios. Food okay but snacks for such a long flight poor. KLM and AF do it better.,1.0
1527,2015-03-25,,British Airways customer review GVA-LGW-GVA A319 out and A320 in. On time in both directions staff were professional and polite. Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.,0.7
1528,2015-03-23,,"British Airways customer review Having heard so many negative reviews of BA I still mustered the courage to book to trip to Chicago and SFO. To begin with when I reached Mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage. We were thru checked in up to Chicago with a 5 hour halt at LHR. London Heathrow Terminal 5 is chaotic to say the least the security taking forever (in our case 45 min) to clear the hand baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded our Chicago flight which was comfortable. Our next connection from Chicago to SFO on AA was a bit messy as the cabin space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was enforced. Then for our SFO-LHR-DEL flight the SFO-LHR got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes because of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. When we requested the flight purser to let us disembark before anyone else he said ""why did you take this connection even if you make it somehow your baggage wont"" - so much for assistance! Even after disembarking last of all we were met by the BA representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to the flight in a record 20 minutes. All went well except for one tiny hitch one piece of baggage never made it to our next flight.",0.7
1529,2015-03-20,,British Airways customer review Flew to and from Punta Cana from Gatwick. Two good flights. Orderly check-in. Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato frankly don't bother. Flights pretty much on time. Both very busy. Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA as the seats and catering are not up to much. Check in was excellent at both ends. There was a minor system glitch at Punta Cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. Top notch.,0.7

1532,2015-03-17,,"British Airways customer review This is not reflective of BA in general only this particular flight. I flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th March. This was the Friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food would have been good save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine Chicken and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows. Anyway I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely underwhelmed. It was nothing short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising.",0.8

First leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. Usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. The return was terrible. BA do not pay for Cub Europe travellers to use Fast Track at security - disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. The lounge is mediocre at best. Absolutely not worth paying for Club. BA need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.,0.2
1535,2015-03-17,,British Airways customer review LHR-PISA-LHR. I have a house in Tuscany so fly there often. I used to fly a certain yellow/blue/white budget carrier from Stansted but got fed up at being treated like an inconvenience and that the FA's consistently spoke poor English. As a Silver card holder my wife and I enjoyed a nice breakfast in the lounge. It was not busy. We were seated in the exit rows which I selected before we left. It was better than the Club Europe space I had last month - which is why I bought economy as opposed to Club which I feel represents very poor value. The plane was a nice new A320 with the new seats. It was spotless. We had a nice snack on both flights + a few Gin and Tonics for me ! (the wife was driving on arrival) The FAs were great. Friendly and treated us like customers - not like cattle. Funnily enough both flights pushed back early and arrived early. Flight home was a bit rough due to high winds around Pisa - and a re-assuring comment over the PA system was a thoughtful touch to nervous flyers - my wife included. All in all BA at its best. They either getting it right or spectacularly wrong. There never appears to be anything in the middle. Am flying again with them in 4 weeks time and look forward to it.,0.4

1538,2015-03-09,,British Airways customer review I flew from LHR to SIN; the aircraft was a Boeing 747-400 which was tired and old. The IFE had to be re-booted and the system was not yet up to date like on other BA aircraft. The seating cover on my Club World seat kept coming off the aircraft seemed very tired. The food again was at a good standard and the crew were helpful. I always fly BA and I love the Boeing 747 but unfortunately the 747 have to go at some point.,0.2
1539,2015-03-09,,British Airways customer review LHR-SOF-LHR 27th Feb/2nd Mar Seat A1 on an A320 in both directions check in at T5 quick used the BA Galleries South lounge which was good as ever. Boarding on time as was departure and arrival new business seats on both aircraft which were comfortable enough. Food (Breakfast) and crew on outbound very good bags waiting once through immigration in Sofia. Return check in quick although security check was so slow the lounge in Sofia is dreadfully dull with no facilities food or drinks passengers would be better of using the general airport facilities! Departure was almost an hour late as was arrival due to weather at Heathrow; otherwise crew were great as was the lunch served.,0.8
1540,2015-02-24,,British Airways customer review Flew BA2043 Gatwick to Male in World Traveller Plus. Plane a Boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. The main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. The choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). I finally got my choice when the Captain gave up his first choice! Other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.,0.5
1541,2015-02-24,,British Airways customer review Returning from St Vincent late on LIAT Airways we landed in Barbados at 1750 for the 1755 flight to Gatwick. The BA and Virgin flights to Gatwick were still on the Tarmac. All Virgin passengers were quickly met by a representative and sent through to the flight. BA customers had to fend for themselves and therefore missed the flight. That meant pleading for a seat on the 21.10 hrs flight. Not good customer relations. I should add the supervisor at check in was brilliant though.,0.3
1542,2015-02-24,,British Airways customer review LGW-AMS on Friday 13th. Flight delayed by almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time reason provided by Captain was late inbound aircraft. (this was my third late running BA flight in as many weeks). No apologies other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight deck surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other than looking after their guests on board. I have two more flights in the coming month with BA rather regretting having booked with this carrier now.,0.7
1543,2015-02-24,,British Airways customer review Beyond Appalling. Flight delayed by ten minutes departing Rome to LHR. As a result one passenger decided he was going to miss his connection in LHR. He was allowed disembark thus leading to a delay in departure from Rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. Consequent late arrival to LHR. Missed connecting flight. Abandoned in Heathrow at 10.30 on a Sunday night had to book new flights miss a day work find a hotel for the night. Ground staff of no use whatsoever. Staff totally unhelpful. Taking things to a logical conclusion what was to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus delaying the flight ad infinitum. Correspondence/ contact with BA has been a joke since.,0.2
1544,2015-02-24,,"British Airways customer review I have always travelled BA and have recently been upgraded to bronze which I would have thought had a few perks? Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part! Time to look at a new airline to fly with.",0.1
1545,2015-02-24,,British Airways customer review I fly BA business regularly between Delhi and London. I was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg. Also why not get some decent magazines - Country life Decanter the Economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of Hello! I residually like BA but they have to up their game.,0.2
1546,2015-02-18,,"British Airways customer review LHR-JFK. End of a One-World RTW trip. What a disappointment. After a mind-numbing trip through Flight Connections (BA to BA) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the B concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride i was escorted to the F/C cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. The seat reclines in one motion so you can't ""fine tune"" it like with other airlines. Menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good desserts and wines OK. EVOD was not to the standards of the competition. Fewer movies and TV selections than either AA or CX. Crew was fine. Stick with AA/CX from now on.",0.5
1547,2015-02-18,,British Airways customer review Cabin crew polite unfortunately BA ran out of chicken ran out of wine ran out of soft drinks. The food was awful. Inflight service was a disaster - did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight everything counts obviously BA overlooked this. To be fair all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. I will never fly again with BA.,0.4
1548,2015-02-18,,British Airways customer review My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.,
1549,2015-02-18,,British Airways customer review Flew F class on the A380 IAD-LHR-IAD. IAD lounge was charming great bar nice Concorde dining room with good service nice food and on my visit an excellent soup. Greeting staff very nice and bartenders that knew how to do their job. Only the slightest downfall was in the Club Class section of the lounge the finger sandwiches were dry as sand and just as flavorful. Station Manager Captain and Inflight Crew were was kind and generous with their time. Food was decent Champagne was great! IFS was strange and not easy to use but got help from FA's on both flights. Arrival at T5 was shocking. Like a heard of rabid bovine charging for the exits. Shoved like sardines into small trains with nothing to hold onto everyone started to tumble. Processing through fast track however was a breeze. Return. F check in is at the far end of the terminal agent at the counter had the personality of wall paper paste. Concorde Room staff were delightful breakfast was nice Massage was ok. Train to gate not nearly the terror it was on arrival. Boarding for First was a snap FA's top notch food ok. Arrival into IAD was as joyus as surgery with long walks confusing machines little help. Overall after reading so much negative about BA I was at least made to feel special at every stop except check in at T5.,1.0
1550,2015-02-11,,British Airways customer review LHR-LAX-LHR Economy. Both legs on lower deck of the A380 professional yet friendly service plenty of drink runs between meal services. Seat comfort superior to LH and AF380s. Travelled with an elderly passenger attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule. So far best transatlantic experience on an A380.,0.5
1551,2015-02-11,,British Airways customer review Sydney to Singapore return late Jan/early Feb 2015. The economy seats were relatively comfortable but could be a bit softer. The away leg (BA16) was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg (BA15) is that if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London by the time online check-in is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.,1.0
1552,2015-02-11,,"British Airways customer review LHR-Zurich. The trip got off to a good start as the North lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test - which it is when it is busy. Had a nice early light lunch. The aircraft was a new A321. I like this plane. It was rammed end to end. The plane had the new Club Europe seats and it reminded me how well BA seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. As with the old C.E. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. Quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits BA they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. This was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide C.E. seat. At the same time justify the higher pricing. Its no wonder BA have very few - if any - Travel Industry awards in the services they provide. So frustrating. I had another light lunch and a couple of Gin and Tonics which was nice. The FAs were great. Flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to Zurich in 80 minutes which was great. The World's favourite airline? Try ""The Worlds most frustrating airline!""",0.7
1553,2015-02-11,,British Airways customer review I flew club world from JHB to LHR on 21/01 on the 747. The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.,0.4
1554,2015-02-11,,"British Airways customer review I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of.",0.8
1555,2015-02-11,,British Airways customer review Flew AMS-LHR-JFK return 26th Dec - 31st Dec. AMS-LHR-AMS on A321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although I got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. How to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own tablet. So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.,0.1
1556,2015-02-06,,British Airways customer review My wife and I flew business class LHR-HKG 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 E&F. Check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was chatting with 2 friends. The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied This was very well cooked and presented the Thai green curry was excellent so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good I had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent I do think dessert and cheese should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. The IFE selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.,0.4
1557,2015-01-28,,British Airways customer review Flew LHR-MIA in WT+. Seats 13E and 13F on 747. It was very comfortable for a day flight and after a light meal I managed to get around 5 hours of sleep. Recline is good and leg room ok for a person of my height 5ft 10in. Food was ok and would have liked to eat my partners sticky toffee pudding because mine went down too well! We were off the plane first at MIA before First and club which was rather nifty. Good experience.,0.6
1558,2015-01-28,,British Airways customer review Return flight from LHR T5 to Washington Dulles (IAD) in Club World. Check in was fine even if the layout of the T5 check-in area isn't the most intuitive. Security was efficient. However the BA lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. Outbound flight on the A380. Boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on-time. The Club World cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. It was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. The Club World seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. The entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat USB power socket was working. The general layout of the cabin was terrible. Not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. It makes everything feel cramped and cheap. Meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. Overall I'd rate the outbound experience as 'Okay' for a business class flight. Return flight experience was far from okay. My flight departing IAD at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. Told that there were no Club World seats on the earlier flight out of IAD that night which I could just about make at a push and I would have to fly back in Economy. When I asked about the BA flight from Baltimore (BWI) an hour later I was told that yes there were Club World seats available that evening so I asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. Arriving at BWI check-in I was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any Club World seats available and I would have to fly back in World Traveller Plus. The flight from BWI to LHR T5 was on a rather old 767. The cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. World Traveller Plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. In-flight food was bland. The crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. Flight left and arrived on time. As a UK passport holder Immigration at T5 was quick. Baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall.,0.8

I never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. In the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. When the passenger in front put his seat back I couldn't use the tray and when I asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. Poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. BA are miles behind the Far and Middle East airlines and still charging more. I have no idea why people use them.,0.2
1565,2015-01-23,,British Airways customer review Bangkok to London Heathrow. 8 Sep 2014. On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat. The flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. Never again.,0.3

BA is far behind a lot of airlines in business class. The seat is small if you are over 6 feet tall. Staff ok. They don't go out of their way. It seems that they are just doing their job. You don't see them between meals. They need to step up their game. I don't think BA is a 4 star airline. I would only recommend because of direct flight.,0.5
1570,2015-01-19,,British Airways customer review We flew from Gatwick to Jamaica in November. Check in was easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge. The lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but I did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours. Overall quite good and based on this experience I would recommend this product.,0.5

1573,2015-01-19,,British Airways customer review San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.,0.8
1574,2015-01-19,,British Airways customer review Just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to and from Bangkok with BA on 777 aircraft. I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience. Will look to EVA Thai or one of the Middle Eastern airlines next time.,1.0
1575,2015-01-19,,British Airways customer review BA 870 22nd Dec 2014. Flew from London to Budapest. Very satisfied with service staff friendly and professional. Even though this was a fairly short trip food and beverages were very satisfactory. Will definitely recommend this airline.,0.2
1576,2015-01-19,,British Airways customer review LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to fly on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.,1.0
1577,2015-01-19,,"British Airways customer review My wife and I travelled from Manchester to Las Vegas via Heathrow. The flight from Manchester was delayed and then on arrival at LHR the boarding passes which were fine at MAN were no good at LHR. We had to queue for over 2 hours to get more printed. Others with the same problem missed their main flights! The staff at LHR are rude jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort. The 747 seats on the LHR to LV flights were terrible like small deck chairs. Any leg/knee movement from the person behind was felt even with the pillow between me and the seat back. Compared with US Air the seats are much smaller and far more basic. Seating totally unsuitable for long haul flights. The entire cabin is extremely cramped the aisles are so narrow that anyone who is not slim tends to bang into your seat every time they pass. BA brought a whole new meaning to ""cattle class"" The cabin staff were efficient and professional the food was fine. I am not a large person certainly not overweight but I was badly cramped. I would never choose BA for a long haul flight again. We travel from Manchester to Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year. BA is by far the worst carrier we have flown with especially when you add in the extra costs for seat selection etc. Very Poor!",0.6
1578,2015-01-19,,British Airways customer review Regularly travel from BCN to LHR. In addition to booting us out of T5 making international connection more difficult it is now using the newly refurb'd A320s on this route. The ones where BA sneaks another row of seats in between 1 and 10. Already faced with overpriced flights its now insisting on make journeys less comfortable. Less costs more.,0.3
1579,2015-01-19,,"British Airways customer review I have not travelled with BA for almost 7 years as a result of moving to Asia and using carriers like AF/SQ/Emirates. I flew Premium from LHR to MIA on a 747 and horrified to see that the Premium product has not changed in the last 10 years. BA have quite an ageing fleet now when compared to most European and Asian carriers and it really shows. The entertainment screen was absolutely tiny and the charging point is still that ridiculous adapter for which you have to pay an arm and a leg so pleased I found mine from 7 years back! BA must go and have a look at the AF premium product for a wake up call. The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances. I do remember the strap line ""BA the worlds favourite airline"" but sadly they have slipped quite a long way back.",0.3
1580,2015-01-14,,British Airways customer review Flew on 23 December from Shanghai to LHR in first. Only 3 of us in the cabin so service was excellent and very personal. Found the seat and bed both very comfortable and food and drink selection was excellent. IFE wasn't amazing - found stuff to watch but easily got bored. First lived up to my expectations on BA and I'd love to repeat it.,0.5
1581,2015-01-14,,British Airways customer review Wednesday 24th December - 787 Dreamliner LHR to Calgary in Club - Seat 3A. Used the lounges and managed to get a free facial in the Elemis spa. On entering the aircraft it was nice to see the big seats. However it took the staff at least 5 minutes to collect our coats. We were lucky we were travelling as a couple as it would be quite annoying if you were in 3B as the food is served over the dividing barrier. Food was very nice. Being next to the windows it was hard to hear the cabin announcements as the air circulation is quite loud. The windows are different as the change colour instead of the usual blinds. The seat design is very poor for those in seat a rows 1 2 and 6 as they have to step over the person in the row in front if they are lying down. 3A has its own access to the aisle. The seat is ok and does go to a flat bed but with it only being 6ft a lot of people will not be able to stretch out. Disembarking was chaos as the people from the other bit in club and premium tried to get off before us. We managed to get seats for £1000 return in the November sale - I would not like to have paid the usual £6k return as it is not value for money.,0.9
1582,2015-01-14,,"British Airways customer review Being an ex pat I decided to fly the flag from Seattle back to England in November 2014 to celebrate my 60th birthday. I was accompanied by my wife a son and daughter with their spouse's and our 2 year old grandson. Between us all we spent a considerable amount of money to fly economy class. After a short time into the flight we soon discovered the economy seats on the 777 to be extremely small uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway! I wonder what genius came up with that one. Aside from serving us ""steerage"" passengers that stuff they called food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. They wouldn't even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. They didn't even check to see if my grandson needed anything. As far as flying BA again there wont be a next time.",0.8
1583,2015-01-14,,British Airways customer review I flew to Toronto from Manchester via T5 Heathrow on Dec 17 returning on Jan 5. I have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good although I am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money. What I found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at T5 Heathrow. We were herded on to buses like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. Are there not enough gates with air bridges at T5? Why is this necessary. I will be flying to Toronto again in September but I am not sure it will be with BA if this situation persists.,0.1
1584,2015-01-14,,British Airways customer review Flew LHR to Denver Colorado on 26/12/14 - 6/1/15 for a ski holiday. Absolutely disappointed and outraged at the rubbish food served on both flights and obviously what I consider as edible and what BA class as edible we shall truly disagree on - awful food. Coffee rubbish asked for more water and never got any? The inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. The male stewards were fine and happy but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink which never arrived anyway? Thought BA had got rid of that superior lucky to fly with us attitude! Will not fly them again if I can help it.,0.7
1585,2015-01-11,,"British Airways customer review LHR-SFO-LHR. Why do I keep thinking BA will improve? The 747 on this route is falling to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom! Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE systems the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""! Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. Then empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. Both of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and San Fran in December decided no more. They have just got too bad.",0.4
1586,2015-01-11,,British Airways customer review Muscat - Abu Dhabi - London. Delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. No welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. Not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. No cabin checks done on one side ex Abu Dhabi. Menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. Crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience.,0.2
1587,2015-01-11,,British Airways customer review The last trip was in Nov to Washington flew first in the new A380 which is a great aircraft very spacious cabin and extremely quiet. Service and drinks choice fine but their food is always questionable. On the way out had the tasting menu which was good even had two dishes repeated but on the return chose the chicken in a mushroom sauce! This was disgusting and after two bites sent it back. This is not the first time BA's food has been suspect either their club Europe service to Gibraltar also serves up light cold snacks though charging up to £750 return for a 2.5hour flight. For those looking to fly BA the lounges aircraft and staff are good to go but the food needs to be improved.,0.2
1588,2015-01-11,,British Airways customer review We flew from Manchester to LHR to YCC and return over the Christmas period on the Dreamliner. The only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from London. The Dreamliner is narrow and uncomfortable. We had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. The 3-3-3 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats the leg room was just about acceptable. We sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced the risk of being kicked from behind. It was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. The food was typical air line food. The crew were variable. On the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. The lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch. We are returning to Canada in a few months but we will not be using BA despite my husbands Executive Club membership. BA are still great for short haul but they need to rethink the Dreamliner experience.,0.9
1589,2015-01-11,,British Airways customer review Travelled from London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda overall not a very pleasurable experience. The seats were uncomfortable blankets were of poor quality. Seats were crammed too close to one another the pillow provided was also of poor quality. The entertainment system was great for TV shows but terrible for movies only one headphone worked and occasionally the sound would black out the system suffered a few malfunctions but smoothed out once up in the air. The food was delicious but the tea and coffee was poor. Staff service was good but still lots of room for improvement. The aircraft and the experience itself seemed old and dated compared to other carriers I have flown with.,0.5
1590,2015-01-05,,British Airways customer review HAM-LHR Club Europe Seat 2F new cabin. Dear oh dear - surely no one within BA could have said this seat as adequate for people paying a premium. I find the new seat absolutely horrible. It's very tight and I am unable to use my laptop. Flying BA Club Europe is no longer justifiable because its no longer possible to work during the flight. Yes the luggage rack moved to eye level. It does not give the 4 inches or so lost by moving the seats closer together. Seats are also very hard and extremely uncomfortable. Dear BA - please reconsider this terrible new seat an attractive cabin alone does not make for a business class that is useful to business people.,0.5
1591,2015-01-05,,British Airways customer review BA662 26/12/14 LHR-LCA Economy Seat 27K. 37 minutes late leaving Heathrow but that's not unusual for this service made up some of the time but still arrived 30 minutes late into Larnaca. Flight was on an old Boeing 767 - the seating was a bit too firm and not very comfortable. This seat was an exit row so leg room was superb. Gets a little cold here but OK for a flight of this duration. No personal video on demand just old overhead screen system so next to useless. They replace the seats but not the entertainment system and on a flight like this of over four hours it should be better. Food was pretty good with a choice of salad or hot meal with the usual free beverages. Cabin crew were OK nothing special and we never got a pass by the duty free either for some reason they missed out rows 27J/K towards the back. Flight crew gave good flight information and updates. Luggage arrived OK at destination. So to sum up very ordinary very average very late.,0.2
1592,2015-01-05,,"British Airways customer review Travelled Club from MIA to LHR last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare AA flight (which was excellent!) We paid an extra £170 to pre-book seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. It's been several years since I last tried BA Club on a transatlantic flight and I was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. Compared to the Emirates business class I'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before BA are fast becoming the 'Lada' of the Airline business. The seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But worst of all the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! My wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the Cabin Crew first offered her one then said ""Oh sorry of course you're vegetarian!"" and that was it - no alternative! Never again BA!",0.6

1595,2014-12-31,,British Airways customer review My wife and I flew business class upstairs on the A380 Hong Kong to LHR flight BA 26 on the 21/12/14 seats 51 K and J. We found the seats comfortable and the window seat was private with plenty of storage my wife found the reverse to be true of the aisle seat getting out of the window seat is quite tricky. We found the food to be quite tasty. We had the beef tenderloin for dinner which was cooked nicely and tasted very good. The cooked English breakfast was also good. The plane was clean and new looking and the toilets were clean and fresh. Staff service on the whole was reasonable however they did very little other than the main meal services also the head FA was particularly unfriendly bordering on rude. Will we fly BA again after our return on the 23/1/15? Maybe if they are considerably cheaper or Cathay Pacific are full.,0.9
1596,2014-12-31,,British Airways customer review SAN-MUC for a conference. I hold Oneworld Sapphire status yet the BA website didn't recognize and wanted to charge me for advanced seat assignments. After several phone calls with no solution BA finally called American Airlines to verify my status and assigned my seats in advance. Check in at SAN was cramped and disorganized. No offer to upgrade to the next class of service (biz class was only 1/4 full). Lounge was amazing! Boarded the 777-200 3 class service. The plane was outdated. No outlets to charge iPhone/iPad. PVOD screen was slightly bigger than an iPhone 6 screen. PVOD control on the inside of the seat. One slight move and the volume or channel changed. Very frustrating. The cabin crew clearly couldn't care less about the passengers. Meal service wasn't started until 2 hours after take off - very slow. Seats were hard and chipped and broken. I'll never fly the SAN-LHR route again with this equipment. I had better expectations. Turkish and ANZ premium economy are significantly better. However I switched back to Oneworld and don't have many choices. BA needs to up their game if they expect to remain competitive in the global world. AA is even better in economy.,0.5
1597,2014-12-31,,British Airways customer review Really like the new business class cabins on the BA A380 (LHR-JNB) - the dimmed lighting is so civilized and much more conducive to long haul travel and getting some sleep. Why do we need to have those ridiculous lights in cabins on so bright? Chairs seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is the first row of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel. Not great for business class sleeping and poor design there. Great service and food and beverages continue to be high quality great menus also good entertainment selection. Didn't even notice takeoff (which was delayed) as movies etc available before take off. Very good.,0.3
1598,2014-12-31,,"British Airways customer review Washington - LHR. We arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new BA Executive lounge. It is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. Plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. The food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. No complaints so far. We were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the A380. Seats 50A and 50B. I was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. I hope this weird seating design is changed in the near future. It was the so called latest Club World seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. In fact the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. It has been some time since I have flown Club - the last being on a 777 to Antigua in 2010. I am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. We pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed I well put it this way tried to get some sleep. It was a horrendous experience. In 35 years of aviation travel I have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! I simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. The temperature was fine. Noise level was minimal. The ""bed"" was rock hard. To narrow. To short. The seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. I arrived into LHR without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. I had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 Club product - and back then I was 20 kilos heavier. This product is not cheap (On some sectors its as high as £7000 return) - although we purchased our tickets on Avios - with a 1st Class outbound and Club return. The saving grace was a strong tail wind that shot us across the pond in 6.5 hours. I couldn't wait to get off.",0.7

Crew friendly - I had little call to ask them for much but any request was quickly attended to. Return from Bangkok incoming flight (and hence departure from BKK) delayed to ATC in UK BA provided voucher which was more than enough for a good sized breakfast. 777 nowhere near as nice as the A380 noisy seats less comfortable and I got barely any sleep on this 13h flight. FAs not as attentive as going out but no real complaints. Poor choice of entertainment on very small screen. Overall quite good and fair value for money in WT+.,0.1

Good crew there and back on time and generally excellent service. The one thing which places BA apart from Easyjet (I won't even mention Ryanair) is the speed of cabin service because no money changes hands. On Easyjet the trolley makes glacial progress down the aisle whereas on BA things move much more quickly.,0.5
1601,2014-12-22,,British Airways customer review Very satisfactory flight with British Airways from London to Bangkok. Was expecting the worst having read some of the reviews on here. I had one of the window seats where you don't have to climb over somebody to get out and this seat compared favourably with some of the higher ranked airlines as it offers excellent privacy. Everything from check in to departure was seamless and apart from the AVOD which is pretty dated everything else on board was very satisfactory.,1.0
1602,2014-12-22,,British Airways customer review British Airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. The Cancun route and the Nassau routes I have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person. The staff all agree that this was pathetic! No lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.,1.0

I fly this about every six weeks or so normally in Club World but sometimes in Premium just due to the huge price variance. The quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception. Old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service.

1607,2014-12-18,,British Airways customer review AMS-LHR-JNB and CPT-LHR-AMS in club. 767 between Amsterdam and London is just wonderful Love the front cabin. A380 to JNB. This was a late departure. I could see - from the lounge - the A380 arrive at the stand some 30 minutes prior to boarding obviously arriving late from another destination and even though it doesn't require a lot of inside-knowledge to see that such a plane can not be 'turned around' in 60 minutes. However BA did not feel there would be a delay until it called all it's premium passengers from the lounge and had them lined up in 4 separate lanes in front of the counter then announcing a delay of 15 then 30 then 45 minutes: How to get your most appreciated customers furious never hear so many complaints on an airline even before the flight started: terrible ground management: not a good start. Upperdeck club seating is absolutely wonderful and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything. Never realized how much snoring is going on at night first time I had to use earplugs. Food was just terrible and how BA gets away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachets just baffles me. The flight to Jo'burg was obviously done by the more senior crew who have incredible charm wit and the most entertaining sense of humor. That opposed to the 'new crew' on the way back from Cape Town. Old 747 with spacious seating all fine. Crew stressed running all the time no manners no sense of class and definitely no sense of humor. Food was slightly better on this long flight but way below any other European carrier I flew. It was my first time in club on BA I love the seat very comfortable for sleeping. There is a lack of space to put your stuff but other than that: a really nice product. BA lounges definitely stand out in the level of catering (food). Transfer at LHR T 5 was quick and easy but terminal itself is a tacky shopping mall and how - so soon after being delivered as new - half of it was blocked for remodelling. My return to Amsterdam on a new A319 was great. Good breakfast and seating is fine.,0.1
1608,2014-12-18,,British Airways customer review Travelled JFK - LHR late November. The Concorde Room: very nice indeed food not that good for once. Seat 1K: fine comfortable enough but no space at all for small things - even the wardrobe had no storage space. Just room for the coat and shoes below. This compares with American Airlines Business Class which had essentially the same seat loads of storage space and good privacy. AA Business class is equivalent to BA First Class. The service was fantastic as always with BA. Cup of tea excellent and breakfast good. Toiletries bag was fine with all the items needed. Toilet a bit naff for First Class. Value for money simply because the deal I got was really good - BA always do deals late November. Otherwise it would have been poor value. However AA are preferred - BA do not have WiFi.,0.7

Next up at LAX the plane was a good hour late arriving. Finally boarded and the flight was OK. Food was from the Club World menu (WTP) seating fine enough wine good IFE but then landing late at LHR a delay because ""An airbus was at our spot"". Next the airbridge will not work followed by an airbus is in our spot. Over 35 minutes wasted sitting there with children bullying passengers. If the pilot wishes to lie please be consistent. Route back all quite normal but I feel somehow BA have thrown the baby out with the bath water. As a share holder I prefer discounts to dividends which are doubtful ad I preferred using miles to upgrade (try finding flights from the US you can book with ""Avios"" and finally why did that pilot lie to all of us sat there waiting to park?

1611,2014-12-10,,British Airways customer review Phoenix to London - outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. The problem we had started on our return flight home. We boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. After being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. I was attempting to work but when I went to plug in my laptop battery I found that there was no adapter for me to use. Since I could no longer work I decided to put a movie on. The tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. The flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and I give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. I decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. You can imagine my surprise when I saw him sitting in business class with a TV screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. At this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. It doesn't make sense to me. Just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in Phoenix to face another issue. We waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in London. We've flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. The difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn't made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home. Well this time nobody informed us so we stood there waiting for 45 minutes at the baggage claim before we were told.,0.5
1612,2014-12-10,,British Airways customer review LHR to IST in economy. Excellent! I thought it was a new A320 but FA told me it was not new it was refurbished. Well done BA on a good re-design: new lighting seats clever seat-back storage etc. I believe they've reduced the economy seat pitch but the design is such that you don't notice. Dinner was served on this evening flight - a very tasty Chicken curry with cheese/crackers and chocolate mousse desert. A very decent meal for a 4-hour flight in economy. FAs were courteous and efficient. The only negative was security at LHR T5 where there was a long delay because of installation of new machines and security alert that morning.,
1613,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review IAH-LHR B747 which was old but sat upstairs and it made it very pleasant. They charged $129 extra to reserve a business class seat in the upper deck. Do not care for the seating of one seat forward and one backwards. The food was terrible and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too. Felt like I was in economy. Nuts were in a bag and breakfast was not much better. Flight attendants not very friendly.,0.8
1614,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review YVR-LHR-AMS. An uneventful journey with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver was a flashback to the 1990's. Dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating. Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.,0.3
1615,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review Have just completed four flights with British Airways all in Economy and all long-haul. Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant. Heathrow T5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section (A) can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details.,0.5
1616,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review British Airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent 8 hour flight. We made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. When we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. Which is strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. While it's always fun to meet new strangers we will not be flying with British Airways again.,0.8
1617,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review BA216 from Washington to London in World Traveller Plus on BA's new A380 (upper level) - one of the smoothest quietest flights I've experienced in 45 years of flying. Practically everything went off perfectly - less jet noise than on other aircraft decent food great leg-room and seat width a relaxing cabin layout and a top-notch cabin crew (no rating for entertainment since apart from the flight tracker I don't use it) - even the boarding and disembarkation despite being on two levels seemed more orderly than in the past on other aircraft. A success all round.,0.1
1618,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review LHR-BGO on A319. Flight on time and only half full. Drinks and snack on this early departure. Crew very good.,1.0
1619,2014-12-04,,British Airways customer review LHR-SFO-LHR. Out in economy and return in economy plus both in a 747-400. Outbound seating was in the V2 configuration meaning that no exit seats were available but did manage a bulkhead seat which made the journey more pleasant. Staff on this flight were quite poor forgot to serve me dinner and disregarded the call button literally had to physically stop the steward in the aisle to get service. Return in PE cost an extra £240 which is quite steep but the dinner was better as was the space and seat. Service on return was excellent. Breakfast really disappointing cereal bar and a bag of dried fruit who on earth in management in BA came up with this menu?,1.0
1620,2014-11-25,,British Airways customer review Check-in in Toronto was OK no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate. On the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time.,0.5
1621,2014-11-25,,British Airways customer review London City to Florence. LCY is a great stress free airport. On time flight great crew and a really good economy service. We expected the usual BA biscuit or snack but were served a tasty couscous and chicken salad with dessert with plenty of drinks. BA offers a good product from LCY.,0.1
1622,2014-11-25,,British Airways customer review HKG-LHR-Bergen: Stockholm-LHR-HKG - A380 on long haul/A319 for short haul. I always like the forward Club cabin on BA's A380 Upper Deck despite the 7-across seating making it seem a bit cramped. Short delay to outward sector due to technical problems some of which had not been ironed out on take off. The screen dividers IFE and then the seat reclines had problems and required resetting. It was an hour before these were sorted out. My main concern on long-haul is merely sleep. The Qantas lounge in HKG is excellent and so no need to have dinner in flight. Also skipped breakfast as there is an excellent one in the Arrivals lounge. With BA having cancelled the morning flight to Bergen about 5 months after I booked my ticket I was stuck with a lengthy 12-hour connection. En route to Bergen the service for just 10 Club passengers was poor - way below expectations. With only 12 meals boarded of which 6 were a fish curry that no-one wanted (curry on a Norway flight?) 4 of us were stuck with sandwiches from the back. No tea or coffee service unless specifically requested. Return to LHR from Stockholm was a huge improvement. Friendly service quick drinks service and tasty lunch. Slept most of the way back to HKG again deciding not to eat or watch any IFE. In that respect the flight was excellent.,1.0
1623,2014-11-25,,British Airways customer review NBO-LHR Club world and LHR-BOS in economy: generally a pleasant and comfortable experience. I have difficulty reconciling our positive experiences with the negative comments about flight attendants in other posts here. As we boarded in Nairobi the purser welcomed us by name and said how pleased they were to have us back again on BA. Before take-off from London a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us. In all cases attendants were helpful cheerful and efficient. Obviously in Club World staff have more time to spend with passengers. With the exception of the late night dinner out of Nairobi we were impressed with the meal selection and quality. Flights were on time; checked baggage arrived in good condition. Agree that having to pay to reserve seats (if you are not of sufficient One World status) is disappointing. Generally we remain very pleased with British Air certainly the best One World option to Europe and beyond from Boston.,0.7
1624,2014-11-20,,British Airways customer review SFO-LHR-DXB and return DXB-LHR-DEN outbound in premium economy return in business. Positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. Was able to upgrade return at check in at DXB for about $1000 which I thought was worth it. I was not too impressed with WTP product - I still had to pay to get assigned seats which is ridiculous when you are paying extra anyway. The 747 the product looks old and tired. Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. Catering out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost like a TV dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product. Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. Second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy. Overall an okay experience but leagues behind EK/SQ/CX. Not sure when European airlines when if ever will catch up.,0.9
1625,2014-11-20,,British Airways customer review I travel to and from Singapore on BA in Club world most months but this was my first time on the A380 for this trip. On the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed. Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved but it can be crowded. Club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.,0.6
1626,2014-11-20,,"British Airways customer review Flew with my wife LHR-JNB BA055 on an A380 October 31st and back JNB-LHR BA056 November 15th in Business Class. British Airways has invented ""High Density Business Class"" or ""Sardines Business Class"". 8 abreast on the main deck and 7 abreast on the upper deck this cabin configuration is very strange. To be fair the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belongings. You are facing your neighbour and if you seat on a middle seat the access to the aisle is not easy at all. You have no view outside except if you have a window seat. You have the impression of flying in a submarine! On the other hand if you are a little bit claustrophobic fly the competitors. The IFE is OK the screen is large enough but the film selection is under average. The service is good food and beverage OK. To summarize as long as BA proposes (very) attractive fare (that was the case) I will fly again BA if not I will fly the competitors.",0.5
1627,2014-11-20,,British Airways customer review London Heathrow to Zagreb return in economy. Used the BA app to check in at both airports. Both flights on time. I found the crew were friendly and got the job done. They appeared to enjoy their work. The flight back from Zagreb was almost completely full - but the crew were good and ensured that everyone was catered for.,0.6
1628,2014-11-20,,British Airways customer review LHR-MAD Club Europe A320 Seat 2A 15.25 hrs departure: Newly refurbished cabin looked very classy in dark brown leather. Crew was excellent was start to finish. However those new seats are a catastrophe. There is not enough leg room they hardly recline and it's not possible work on a laptop. That's in Business Class. It is just like Easyjet seating but with a business fare price tag. Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. Really? The flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time. Wouldn't a light dinner be more appropriate? Terrible disappointing experience. These new seats have to go and food must improve.,0.9
1629,2014-11-20,,"British Airways customer review MIA-LHR-BKK round trip club world three 777 and one 747. Check-in wait time is short for all flights. Fast pass through passport control and or security at Heathrow and Bangkok a big time-saver. Priority boarding smooth and relatively fast. Miami lounge shared with other airlines but excellent selection of comfortable seating food and drink. Heathrow lounges food offerings lacking. Small Bangkok lounge serviceable but Wi-Fi was down. Cabin service in general good with fairly attentive staff. I did however receive an unprofessional and snide comment about ordering a fourth Kir Royale on my last leg despite the fact that there were six hours left in the flight and I was not showing any signs of drunkenness. I did not pay $8500 to be insulted by cabin crew. Food over the four flights was inconsistent ranging from tasty to inedible. IFE showed the same movies on all four flights despite the fact that I flew in two different markets and my return was a full month after outbound flight. As I am only 5'3"" tall the seat was more than adequate though I could see how taller people would have a problem with it. Also I find it ridiculous that you must pay to choose your seat more than 24 hours before flight. Aisle seats are preferable as those on the inside must climb over the feet of the aisle passenger to get out into the aisle. Good overall experience except for a few pointed gaffes. On the fence as to whether the price is worth it.",0.2

1631,2014-11-20,,British Airways customer review LHR-VIE in Club Europe on A320. Plane was an ex-BMI aircraft so it still had the old seats which are wider than the refurbished aircraft. Aircraft was clean and well-maintained. Good amount of legroom in row 1. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Seat was comfortable. On-board catering reasonably good with champagne offered. Flight was on time. Luggage delivered with priority. No IFE offered. Happy to fly with BA again if price remains competitive.,0.4
1632,2014-11-17,,British Airways customer review Just flew to and from New York JFK with BA flight out was great modern plane comfy seats and cabin crew who seemed to enjoy their jobs. Unfortunately the flight back was very different old tired jumbo plane poor seating poor in-flight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly couldn't be bothered and everything seemed to be too much trouble. Plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the air-con on nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. Have flown long haul with Virgin and Cathay Pacific and these were much better on all fronts would only consider BA in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers!,0.9
1633,2014-11-17,,British Airways customer review I had a very poor experience with BA from Jo'burg to London was cancelled. We were kept on the tarmac for four hours with very little information and eventually told there was a technical fault so we would not be flying for another 24 hours. I needed to call my workplace to arrange work cover but the cabin staff said there was no BA phone I could use. Passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little direction on what to do. We were eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel staff were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms - families were separated. BA did not publicise the right of all passengers to EU compensation but I knew about this so did apply and receive the legally required amount promptly. All in all this was a hugely disappointing and frustrating experience from an airline that had previously been my preferred airline and I would no longer recommend BA.,0.6
1634,2014-11-17,,British Airways customer review Flew MCT to LHR on 1 Nov 14. Staff at Muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife (who is a wheelchair user). Catering on the flight was awful. Food was inedible and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. On arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user (despite having assistance booked in advance) which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. We flew out on Oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff.,0.1
1635,2014-11-17,,British Airways customer review LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!,0.3
1636,2014-11-12,,British Airways customer review Kingston - London Gatwick in club world. Check in and fast track very efficient without any delays. Lounge surprisingly good comfortable with a reasonable selection of food and drinks inclusive of sushi rolls and bar service with cocktails and champagne. It must be on of the best lounges in West Indies. Priority boarding excellent. Business class passengers are escorted to the gate. Entering the plane and during the entire flight greeted and addressed by name. Staff very efficient friendly and smiling - willing to assist during the entire overnight flight. Relatively new plane with comfortable flat bed seats and a good entertainment system. Good selection of movies. Dinner and breakfast of a good standard and a great selection of spirits wine and champagne. Child's meal very thoughtfully done. Slept for 6 hours. Flight on time and swift luggage delivery. High standard of service with excellent value for money.,0.2
1637,2014-11-12,,British Airways customer review LHR-JNB 15/10. I cannot understand why BA have chosen the seating arrangement in Club World on the new A380 with one seat facing forward and the seat next to you facing backwards so as to be facing your neighbour.

1640,2014-11-06,,British Airways customer review Sunday 2/11 Dublin to Heathrow. Flight arrived late and departed even later due to the absolutely ridiculous length of time it took to board people. Finally got to my seat to discover a young girl with two kids occupying it. Shifted them out the way and continued.

Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge. I find that the BA lounge at Gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast pastries and condiments! The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice. All in all BA offer a good Club Europe service they are trying to cut back and this often shows they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of Easyjet or Ryanair.,0.3

In flight service to economy poor very few drinks people having to go to the galley to get water or juice. Special meal on return awful and inedible. We ordered the same but got a different dish. Didn't eat it. Return flight delayed over an hour due to sick passenger which necessitated return to stand and passenger/ bag offload. Entertainment system unreliable screen cutting out.

Flight itself a disaster old tatty B747 in need of an urgent revamp. Very used and ran down seats. Cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. Ran out of champagne. Food not good at all. Inflight entertainment and videos a bore with very old titles. Bags not first out. Return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took in case food was same disaster as flight in.

Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room.

We were travelling with a 4 month old and the crew were faultless. So helpful and caring as they could tell we were nervous about disturbing other club world passengers. Food good - fresh and tasty. Entertainment not really used due to entertaining daughter! Left and arrived on time - BA lounge Gatwick fine but thought was a bit small.

1649,2014-11-03,,British Airways customer review Went to BKK via Heathrow on 26th October. Was all excited to be flying back to Thailand. I know direct flights are better but longer but thought flying with the UK flag carrier I was going to get a good flight. Well to be honest I was disappointed - I was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. Most other airlines have this facility in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in. Even the documentaries were all BBC which were ok. Music was equally lacklustre and limited. Only saving grace was the seat I was in and that was the only positive aspect despite the fact there was a baby crying most of the time. Sorry BA. I was expecting a good experience but felt let down and disappointed.,0.3

Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything.

One thing I did not like was the layout making it difficult for people in the middle to have aisle access when seat were turned into beds. And staring directly into people's faces when the curtain between seats is down can be awkward. Crew didn't care too much about safety issues like seat reclining and window blinds for takeoff and landing. Entertainment was a bit disappointing screens were old and blurry not a big selection.,0.1
1653,2014-10-28,,"British Airways customer review Traveled with British Airways ORD-LHR last month World Traveller on the way out and Club World on the return. Connected to DSM via American Airlines and could see a marked difference in the level of service as well as the hard product. Flew on a B777 both ways and was impressed with the amount of room both in economy and business. USB ports 1 in economy and 2 in business and large entertainment screens. The food in economy was better than I have had on domestic (US) first class and the pitch was comfortable for my 6'1"" frame. Attentive cabin staff who made sure I was comfortable. Drink service in Club world was excellent a good Rose Cointreau and Tanqueray. Lie flat bed fairly comfortable and was able to sleep for 3-4 hours. Due to changes in travel plans I had to pay a change ticket fee but even with that and the cost to upgrade to Club World I felt that I got more than my money's worth. 1 free checked bag for World Traveller and then 3 free with Club World made navigating the airport a breeze. Will fly British Airways the next chance I get.",0.9
1654,2014-10-28,,British Airways customer review Travelled to Palma in new BA 'sardine' business class. Uncomfortable seats with Ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. Poor service. Despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later causing misery. Other passengers also shocked at conditions. If this is the new look business class BA then better off with Easyjet or Ryanair much cheaper and service could not be much worse.,0.9
1655,2014-10-28,,British Airways customer review Gatwick to Marrakech and back. Bag drop was fast premium security slow (not BAs fault). Faultless calm boarding on time and a great flight with good service and refreshments. Return flight bag drop even better departure a little late due to a technical problem the 737s are getting on a bit. Again great inflight service and only a little late. Bags arrived as we got to the belt. Am very glad we chose BA for a 3 hour flight. Really good.,0.1
1656,2014-10-28,,British Airways customer review We flew London Heathrow to Singapore business class for the first time with BA and was not impressed - the cabin crew did the bare minimum they could get away with and as for the seating arrangement we just could not get our head around it - thank goodness we changed our seats prior to flight - we sat on the 2 outer seats that were ok though a bit narrow - felt so sorry for the people who sat in the middle seats as they had to face strangers on the take off and landing - we fly long haul on this route 4 times a year and can quite honestly say that after our experience with BA we would not wish to fly with them again.,0.9

1658,2014-10-28,,British Airways customer review LHR-DEL. RTN Club World. Excellent service on both sectors and found that middle seats are good for companions. I found the rearward seating disconcerting but was otherwise comfortable. Flight crews were excellent. I would agree with aisle passengers that they must find the need to reach across them at service times irritating.,0.8
1659,2014-10-28,,British Airways customer review Flew BA from Toronto to New Delhi via London in Premium Economy class in August. First leg was on a 787 plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. Premium Economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad bad design). On board service was very good staff were great food was good. Next leg from London to New Delhi was on a 777 much better in my opinion that the Dreamliner primarily as it has better toilet facilities. Again staff and service were top notch. Our return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff but other than that the seats were OK not excellent but definitely comfortable enough. Considering that I hadn't flown BA for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) I was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. Yes being in Premium Economy helped but I was very satisfied comparing it to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly used. Well done BA you made a trip that we were dreading actually quite a pleasant experience and I'm likely to fly BA again now.,1.0
1660,2014-10-22,,British Airways customer review I fly the POS to LGW route on a fairly regular basis and the punctuality of the flight is bad. I suffered two 6 hour delays within 5 weeks on this route. The air steward wasn't friendly at all and was borderline aggressive when asking passengers to take a seat when the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. The inflight entertainment needs updating. The screens are small and the resolution low. The seats were not comfortable either and you can feel every movement of the passenger which is sat behind you whenever they reached for something in the seat pocket.,0.5
1661,2014-10-22,,British Airways customer review I recently flew on British Airways long haul on a flight from Philadelphia to New Delhi havinh not having travelled with British Airway for around a decade. I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrow's new Terminal 5. British Airway's overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the Delhi-London sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the London-Philadelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality - informal politeness. All in all I was happy with my BA trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.,0.5
1662,2014-10-22,,British Airways customer review LGW-AGP and back. 737-400s on both journeys. These aircraft are looking very tatty now - seats worn cabins grimy and dingy. The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. No choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. Although we benefited from it on this trip BA need to change their hand luggage policy. There simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full). On the upside both flights were on time and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.,1.0
1663,2014-10-20,,"British Airways customer review Aberdeen-Heathrow-Miami and return World Traveller Plus (premium economy). Received a text from BA at 0600 that our 09:30 ABZ-LHR flight had been cancelled which would impact upon the US flight. Phoned the helpline as suggested. Utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday. Made unsuitable suggestions including can you get to Aberdeen for the 7:30 flight (it was 7am and had now spent 1hr on phone to them). Gave up and just went to the airport. Fortunately BA staff there were excellent and got me on next flight to Heathrow despite breaching their own min of 1 hour requirement for connections. Flight to London was good with good service leather seats. Cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and BA staff member met us to get us to next gate ASAP for Miami flight. Service centre useless but face to face staff great. LHR-MIA flight. Aircraft a 747 was old and tatty and WT+ seats were rubbish in comparison to Virgin product that I have experienced. Not that comfortable. Seat back TV is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy. Food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. Staff were pretty good. Aircraft on time. Return journey much the same but staff were better. Conclusion is that face to face staff great food great. But needs a modern fleet - our 747 was really aged and their world traveller plus product needs work with hindsight probably would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more. If you take a iPad to watch movies and are not tall economy would do the job. Their helpline needs to be addressed. Clue being in the title - HELPline. Would fly BA again but would think about their WT+ option carefully.",0.5
1664,2014-10-20,,British Airways customer review LHR-DEN DEN-LHR - always use upper class in VA when I can. This flight reminded me of just why I rarely fly BA. Most of the crew were disinterested. I raised a couple of points but I was told I was wrong both times. Asked for another glass of wine twice with my main the stewardess forgot and denied that I had even asked for one. Food going out was pretty good but coming home just awful. I for one can just not get my head round the seat formation. You stare at some stranger on take off and landing food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face.,0.8
1665,2014-10-20,,British Airways customer review I flew one way MCO-LGW 6th October the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations British Airways has lost a customer for life. I requested assistance due to illness which I couldn't have at Orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? When boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because I was young and didn't appear to need assistance. After this I could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if I was ok. The drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. The meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route. When I got to Gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance. Never again BA.,0.4

1667,2014-10-20,,"British Airways customer review LGW to CMB via MLE and return Sept/Oct 2014. As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary ""A Very British Airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.",1.0
1668,2014-10-20,,British Airways customer review Flew from LGW to Catania. Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control. Flights both ways were good and we liked the Pilot pointing out Lake Geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. The return flight back to LGW the Captain was hard to hear and wasn't so interesting. That aside on both journeys we felt well looked after with charming FAs. The food was also good too and we landed on time. Baggage came very quickly at LGW but at Catania airport it was a bit of a carnival! I'm afraid Catania airport is the worst airport I've been through but there you go! I think it is one of the joys of travelling.,0.4

Full flight both ways quite unhappy staff on return leg tiny seatback screens and poor selection of entertainment meals satisfactory (taste was ok and enough to fill me up both legs on time but was quite expensive for the service I got.

1670,2014-10-12,,British Airways customer review We flew BA from London to Dulles DC 10/8/2014. Unfortunately we were seated in economy so space was very tight but the staff could not have been anymore accommodating which greatly helped.,0.5
1671,2014-10-12,,"British Airways customer review B787. Just returned from a London - Toronto - London flight. BA appear to be proud of their new ""Dreamliner"" but they have scored a real own-goal by cramming 9 seats into each row 3+3+3. The only way this has been achieved is by fitting seats that are far narrower than the norm. We are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this was the first time I have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat - and I am quite slimly-built! Unless BA changes their 787s to a less-cramped layout I will now have no alternative but to make sure I am not flying in a 787 thus often avoiding BA altogether. I will let a BA steward have the last word: ""The first time I sat in one of these seats I could not believe how bad they are"" - and he like me is slim. Come on BA - start having a little regard for your customers' comfort and health.",0.5
1672,2014-10-12,,British Airways customer review I travelled to Hong Kong with British Airways from Heathrow on a 777-200 outbound and one of their new A380's on the way back both in World Traveller. It had been a long time since I had travelled with BA (18 years!) but it was one of my better flying experiences. I didn't know what to expect this time round but the seats had plenty of leg room on the 777 on the way out. I was annoyed as I was told to pull my window blind down as other people were sleeping although I had specifically asked for the window seat for a reason. However the crew were great and asked if I'd like to look out of the window by the jump seat which I did for a good few hours! Not only that the crew called the flight crew and the co-pilot walked to the back of the plane to have a chat with me and gave me a map with all the points of interest highlighted with the times we would be above them! Airlines don't have to spend any money to truly satisfy passengers. The seat on the 777 was quite comfortable and the IFE had plenty of selection. The food was good not dried out and it was tasty. All the toilets were operational and were clean. On the way back I was upstairs on the A380. The aircraft was extremely clean comfortable and the A380 was ever so quiet in all areas of the flight which really surprised me. I really loved the 'seat locker' next to my window seat which easily fitted the contents of my hand luggage. Food was good again and the crew were again amazing allowing me to visit the flight deck after the flight had safely arrived at Heathrow. Toilets were clean and tody and all operational and the IFE was good. Leg room was good. The only thing I would say is that the IFE does take up a lot of space under the seat meaning that hand luggage cannot really be stored there and it can get in the way of your feet.,0.2
1673,2014-10-12,,British Airways customer review LHR-MXP-LHR. Check in/bag drop at T5 once again very slow appears to be a staff shortage at some times of the day. My FFS allows me to use the lounge so I had time for a quick coffee I like the BA lounges at T5. Boarding on time seat 26A on a A320 seemed new with a nice crew a snack and a drink served. Return check in quick Milan Malpenza Airport is horrible! Managed to find lounge close to B35 limited food but quiet wifi was poor although there is a smoking lounge. Boarding quick seat 19A and another newish A319 full flight snack and drink served crew very chatty early arrival at T5. Good product although I booked on day of travel so a bit expensive.,0.9
1674,2014-10-12,,British Airways customer review Took 6 BA flights as part of a OneWorld RTW trip. JFK to Berlin via LHR then 4 days later Berlin to MAN via LHR and 6 weeks later Nice to DXB again via LHR. All flights on time all cabin crew polite attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line' but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights. Did not use IFE so unable to give a rating.,0.9
1675,2014-10-08,,British Airways customer review VIE to LHR - Seats were of the new configuration only 30 inches both in Club and Economy. The seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. The new cabin looks very small with the new seats and I would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with BA now. The service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations. I hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. BA short hall can now be classified as a Low Cost Carrier now they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs.,0.9
1676,2014-10-08,,"British Airways customer review LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice. I would not trust or travel with them again.",0.1

New plane with the smallest seats ever. Many passengers tried to stand the entire trip to avoid the discomfort!

Flights were on time both ways food was reasonably good & cabin staff were charming (specially on the outboard flight). I was surprised to find BA no longer has a Club Lounge at Paphos and even more surprised to find that there was a comfortable lounge there that BA Club Europe passengers were unable to use. We were given vouchers as compensation and thought we would at least get a glass of wine and a sandwich - but no. The vouchers were of such low value they could only be redeemed for things like a local beer crisps and chewing gum. Even though the flights were quite good I feel that BA are treating their Club Europe passengers with contempt by denying them any lounge access or reasonable compensation - also by refitting their aircraft to give passengers less seat width and the same legroom as economy. Why pay a premium price for a non premium product?",0.5
1681,2014-10-01,,British Airways customer review Economy from LAX to CPT via LHR. Airbus 380 on first leg 747 on second. Both flights completely full. Airbus quiet - on upper deck with a window seat. Room underseat very limited due to two entertainment boxes but storage by window as compensation. For a new plane seat isn't very comfortable - rather hard and I prefer the old-style head rest on the 747s. Great entertainment screen. 747 seat v comfortable and softer but plane is showing its age and noisy after a 380 flight and the seat back screens smaller than many phones these days. Staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the CPT leg. Special meal not provided on last section of CPT leg - otherwise provided and edible. Boarding easy at LAX more chaotic with less waiting area space at Heathrow - they really didn't plan the waiting areas well at Heathrow - just too cramped and poor layout. And transferring through from section c to section a and then back to section b at Heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so would avoid if possible. Otherwise flights on time at both destinations despite leaving late. Heathrow is the main drawback when using BA and transferring - what a shame that they didn't make it easier when planning the new terminal. LAX was a joy to use in comparison - so smooth and staff extremely pleasant and helpful despite having a poor reputation.,0.7

Staff were indifferent and inattentive. The meals were deplorable! Despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service - a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. Hardly suitable food for a long flight. Breakfast was worse - an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. Very poor! A number of seats in this cabin have metal boxes underneath rendering the much-advertised additional leg room useless. IFE far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming.

1689,2014-09-28,,"British Airways customer review LGW to Alicante out on 8th September early flight. I was disappointed that due to BA changing the aircraft the seat in the exit row that I booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. The seat allocated on the Boeing was quite cramped for my frame and I was not that comfortable. I had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all I got was a request to phone BA after the flight. There must have been other passengers affected in this change. That said the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. Staff attentive and pleasant. The return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as I had requested. The snack was fine and the small bottle of Pinotage was pleasant enough. Due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. I think that BA needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair seem to be able to do. However by booking early I got a great price decent luggage allowance and a snack so I can't complain. I also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines.

1695,2014-09-18,,British Airways customer review LHR-LIS in Club Europe (on Avios). Easy check-in and security. BA lounge reasonable - good selection of drinks food slightly stale looking but tasty enough. Bus out to plane. Nice welcome in Club Europe cabin on brand new A320. Seats comfortable albeit less legroom than expected. Food excellent served by very attentive cabin crew. Good updates from pilot. Very good flight overall.,0.2
1696,2014-09-18,,British Airways customer review Flew between LHR and JFK and the return leg was IAD to LHR and onward to KUL on MH. I must say BA has an excellent product offering. The crew are extremely friendly and are attentive. They are kept busy the entire flight with juice and water being served consistently. The only setback is that their B747 have seen better days and is in dire need of a refurbishment. Food was good but the IFE could be improved further with enhanced audio and video selection. I will surely fly with BA again. To the crew keep up the good work.,0.9
1697,2014-09-18,,British Airways customer review Flew Heathrow - Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from Spain.,0.8
1698,2014-09-18,,British Airways customer review Flew LHR-BUD 11 Sep BA866 and return 15 Sep BA 869 Club Europe. Early morning flight from T3 so breakfast in lounge. Usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. Had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. Managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. Plane had been refitted with the new layout. Beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in Club. Big disappointment. It feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. Not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. Friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. Coffee still poor however. No IFE apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. BUD airport a disaster. No time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. No aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. Very uncomfortable and unpleasant. On return the lounge BA shares at BUD is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. A short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. Priority boarding worked well. Same plane configuration on return. Excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. FAs free with the booze and nuts. Food was again a surprise - I had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. Very tasty. BA can be hit and miss but I thoroughly enjoyed both flights. A great soft product if they can maintain the standard but the new fit out is a disappointment.,0.2
1699,2014-09-17,,British Airways customer review My British Airways experience LHR to Paris CDG was excellent. I was travelling with an infant. The staff at LHR were so helpful and kind and went out of their way to help me. However it was a very different story on the way back. Everyone in Paris CDG was so rude. BA made me check-in my pushchair which meant I had to carry a 14month old boy (15kg) to the gate. It made my trip impossible. I pleaded with the man at check-in. There was no pre- boarding with infants. I will be taking the Eurostar never flying again especially not to Paris.,0.8
1700,2014-09-14,,British Airways customer review First and last time flying with BA upgraded the 4 of us to Premium Economy at £199 each for 4 of us a complete waste of money. Have done this with Virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive. Food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food. None of us could eat the food it was so bad. On a 9 hour flight we were hungry. Don't waste your money upgrading I wish I had read reviews before I left.,0.5
1701,2014-09-14,,British Airways customer review Flew SYD-SIN and had a reasonably comfortable trip. Problem is I didn't see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking. Service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks and plenty of water. Everyone rather terse I thought and not helpful. Not my favourite to fly. The aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people.,0.1
1702,2014-09-14,,British Airways customer review Madrid-London on 9 September on Boeing 767 aircraft. No queue at check-in and welcoming polite and efficient agent. Priority tag applied to suitcase. Lounge experience at Barajas Terminal 4 was generally positive. Plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. Priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers. My main gripes are: old aircraft fairly surly crew and a consistent inability to monitor hand luggage (I saw several cases that were larger than the bag I checked in being forced into the overhead lockers). I was in seat 27A which as an exit row seat had plenty of leg room. Full bar service and a chicken tikka flatbread (and vegetarian equivalent) offered. Arrived at Terminal 5B. Bags arrived with minimal (less than 5 minute wait). Overall a decent experience - I will continue to fly with BA provided seats are available at a good price.,0.1
1703,2014-09-14,,British Airways customer review 9/8/14 LHR-EWR in WC. Clean aircraft but moderate dysfunction of armrest foot stool and video screen. We find this seating configuration very uncomfortable and will avoid BA when possible. One FA spent this flight chatting w. friend to the blockage of aisle and detriment of service. Dinner was fairly horrid (beef) except for salad and cheese. Late departure and 40 min late arrival with no explanations given.,0.7
1704,2014-09-09,,"British Airways customer review LHR-MCT-LHR. Excellent outbound flight. Tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isn't up to much in terms of choice. Different story on the way back though. Stand-offish cabin crew and no white champagne. Rose only as ""we haven't been fully catered"". Not a big thing but indicative of how slip shod BA can sometimes be these days. The seat is comfortable so I slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink.",0.2
1705,2014-09-09,,British Airways customer review Travelled YYZ-LHR-ARN and return in mid August. Check in at Pearson was a bit delayed (only one counter open 2-3 hrs before departure although it is advised that passengers arrive that early). Premium economy cabin inside the Boeing 787 (Dreamliner) is very pleasant and the flight from Toronto to London was very comfortable. Transfer at LHR T5 takes time is something I learned on this trip. 1hr connection is for sure pushing it and you're likely to miss your onward connection with anything less than 1.5 hrs transfer time. We missed our connection to ARN (our connection was only 1hr) because of the long line ups at the transfer centre. The fact that you go through security again in LHR takes some time as well. On my way back to Toronto check in at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport was easy and very smooth. The flight to LHR went fine and I had to spend almost an hour lining up at transfer centre going through security. This is the part of the transfer that for sure takes time. After a train ride to the C gates and a fairly smooth boarding I was onboard the flight to Toronto. I had been upgraded to Business class which was pleasant. Service onboard was professional and courteous. Landing in Toronto was a bit delayed due delayed take off from Heathrow. My overall w BA was good. However transfer in LHR is probably one of the more lengthier ones in Europe I think. I preferred the short transfer at KEF on my last trip to Sweden a few months ago.,0.5
1706,2014-09-09,,British Airways customer review Flew BA 215 LHR-BOS in economy on an ageing 747. Flight was 45 minutes late taking off. Seat was uncomfortable and cramped.Meal served was overcooked slop. IFE had glitches but worked eventually. Overhead light didn't work. The larger people become and they are the less space BA seems to give anyone. The plus point was the politeness and professionalism of the cabin staff.,0.7
1707,2014-09-09,,British Airways customer review LHR - IST. T5 efficient as usual no queues at check in or security. Proceeded to the lounge where we relaxed and watched planes take off with glass of champagne. Boarded on time cabin crew friendly food was excellent and of course more champagne! The only thing that BA need to do (which I believe they are). Is to retire these old aircraft. The overall product is excellent but I think the cabin crew are let down by the ageing planes. (IFE not personal to you etc).,0.1
1708,2014-09-09,,British Airways customer review Just came back this morning on a flight from Dubai - BA106. I was not impressed. The cabin crew were just not friendly or helpful. The plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. It look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. BA was so particular before what's happened? The cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. The food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. I have to ask for water a number of times. There was no genuine warmth. It was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. I'd love to fly BA and support them but this is appalling. I would not recommended this - Next time we are flying eremites. Pay the extra. BTW I noticed a number of other people have complained about this crew on the site too - seems consistently bad.,0.8
1709,2014-09-09,,British Airways customer review Flew Heathrow to Lyon return. Late flight on the way out but made up all but 10 mins of the time. Catering hardly worth the effort as comprised unappetising looking sandwich and one drink (not even tea or coffee on the outbound). Crew good and check in very good especially at Heathrow.,0.1
1710,2014-09-06,,British Airways customer review We flew indirect to Orlando and back - although the Miami/Orlando Orlando/Dallas and Dallas/London flights were with American Airlines (BA partners). The BA flight BA0209 was an old plane - the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor. Your own screen but no control over the films which all ran at different times. Having only flown Virgin and Singapore long haul BA rated way behind in all aspects. But that was nothing compared to the 737-300 we flew on with American Airlines from Dallas to London (BA 1531). I understand they are upgrading their fleet and I can see why having flown on the old plane we were unfortunate enough to fly on. The first 20 mins the plane stank like a toilet to the extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest delayed take off. The inflight entertainment was a joke - a poor quality shared screen with 30 others two films and no choice. The crew were the unfriendliest I have ever encountered - no meet and greet or goodbyes. I thought booking through BA would ensure some level of quality and that they would demand a certain level of quality from their partners but unfortunately not. The worst flight ever (we are a family of five) and I will not be flying BA again.,0.5
1711,2014-09-06,,British Airways customer review LHR-PHL on a 787 Dreamliner seat 3K. I recommend seats 3K 3A 7A and 7K as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb over your feet when they leave their seat. The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. The service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better. The aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the conventional blind.,0.1
1712,2014-09-01,,"British Airways customer review Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going via Dubai on Emirates in future.",0.9

B gate lounge quiet nice refreshments-I don't think the children's games consoles have worked in the entire time T5 has been open. Short walk to boarding full plane left slightly early landed well ahead of schedule. Crew excellent worked hard throughout. Decent food as well (again). Entertainment out on new system good older system back not as good and screen not in best order.

Return flights similar. Faults lay in ground services at EDI and T5 in LHR the latter overcrowded and rather scruffy. Return flight had no magazines (""they forgot to load"") or individual bottled water (""they forgot to load""). Have a need to return to UK so will try an alternative (which is a night flight).

1715,2014-09-01,,British Airways customer review LGW-MCO-LGW 11-25th August Economy Class. Got to the gate lounge to be told our seats has been reallocated to another seat this was the reason why - it was because there was a big family party that didn't want to separate - considering I paid a lot of money for my family to sit all together. Got on to the plane thinking it would be the same as Virgin Atlantic but no it wasn't it was an old plane tatty one as well. Food and drinks were limited on the whole 9 hour flight no snacks on board. The food was limited and when we got ours the people in front decide to recline there chairs in front so within that we have told hold our dinners luckily we didn't get burnt. Well sorry BA next time I am flying with VA!,0.7

As a regular traveller on this route have now got used to the ex BMI airbuses on this route the seating is perfectly comfortable despite the reduced seat pitch and have never had any problems when requesting more than one drink during the flight. The crew were fantastic in both directions and were totally service orientated from start to finish. Only one minor issue and that is the only one toilet at the rear for the whole economy cabin!,0.2
1717,2014-09-01,,"British Airways customer review I have flown twice with BA now in business class (to and from Delhi) and I have to say it has been absolutely poor! Me and a few colleagues flew out to New Delhi for a business trip. BA were the pioneers of aircraft's after all they did create The Concorde. Key word in that is ""were"" they've basically turned into a no frills airline. Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape! The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special. Normally its the little things that make the differences but with BA they need a total make over. For a flight that happens everyday from London to Delhi BA should be doing more. The decor of the plane matched the experience I got with BA dull. I won't be flying long haul with them again. My advice - avoid BA and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you.",1.0
1718,2014-09-01,,British Airways customer review Flew from London to Doha on a newly refurbished 777. Smooth ride through airport and pleasant staff on hand to help. Boarding was on time but there was a slight delay which put us back by half an hour and delayed take off. Captain was good at keeping us informed. Cabin Crew friendly enough but seemed tired in their service and no smile. Food was average and not anything to write home about. I felt I had to eat quickly as the flight attendant was waiting for me to finish my last bite with a stern look! Inflight entertainment was excellent and kept me entertained throughout the six hours you have got an array of movies TV games and Music to choose from. Seats were really comfy and I got a good kip. Overall an enjoyable experience and I would definitely fly BA again.,0.3
1719,2014-09-01,,British Airways customer review ATL to LHR: Boeing 777 (Economy). I've just returned from a family holiday in the USA and flew BA Economy. The flight was slightly delayed but most of this delay was made up during the journey. Staff were pleasant and the IFE was fine. However the food was terrible. Main meal was a choice of Chicken Curry and Rice or a Veggie Pasta. Breakfast before landing was a cold box consisting of a Croissant bag of Cranberries and a Granola Bar. What has happened to the 2 meat choices? (Veggies choose veggie option in advance) and a cooked breakfast? BA have a British flag on the tail but do not serve any British food. I'm a Silver Executive Club member and food on BA has been deteriorating over the last couple of years. I've made several complaints.,0.9
1720,2014-08-28,,British Airways customer review BA12 15th August 2014. In my mind that when I bought the BA tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. It turned out to be totally wrong. I used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with BA from Changi Airport to Heathrow was the worst in so many ways. Not worth money spent at all! Firstly the seat space was really small (I cant imagine those who are bigger than I am because I am a medium size person). Secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. They only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. Thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). Lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. The movies selection must have been 2 years old. Flimsy earphones and outdated screens. All in all an unhappy customer.,0.5
1721,2014-08-28,,British Airways customer review Bari to Gatwick. This flight seems to be late on a regular basis. Three times an hour late and once two hours late this summer of the four times I was involved. Seems the summer schedule is very optimistic Check-in at Bari is hopeless always queues and 'bag drop' seems to be used by travellers with ticketing problems. Boarding is poor regularly left to wait in a hot air bridge between the gate and the plane. None of this done by BA staff but they are doing BA's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to London. Onboard though is always good despite the age of the planes. Fair choice of drinks and a good sandwich nice crew. My flight ended with a 50 minute wait for luggage. A lot for BA to address here.,0.4

Food tasty and well presented but not quite First Class and cost-cutting was evident. The New First seat is comfortable though the footrest is poorly designed and a storage area for small inflight items is missing. IFE monitor controls and selection very good but the screen could be more adjustable for reach. Lovely cabin ambience including colors textures mood lighting and window blinds. Toilets cramped and stocked with the cheapest liquid soaps and toilet paper. Overall an enjoyable flight but as a longstanding and very loyal BA customer (Gold Tier) I ask that they seriously consider improving their product in an increasingly competitive market.

The salad on the outward flight was exceptional and the steward on the return leg (in a near-full cabin) was anticipating what passengers might want. BA food baffles me. I've flown First a few times in the past few years and the food was so bad I thought BA should pay compensation as well as refunding the flight ticket. In Business it is usually OK. The only letdown this time was the lounge at Gatwick. It was like a Ryanair holding pen.,0.9
1724,2014-08-26,,British Airways customer review On 28th July flew from Edinburgh to Gatwick. Flight was delayed 3 hours as it had been hit by lightening on the flight this we accepted but what happened afterwards means I will never use them again. 1) Information or details of what was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2) At no time was any refreshment offered. 3) The flight was further delayed to allow people to transfer back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight rather than wait to see what was happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4) No breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5) Although they stated we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service was provided this consisted of 4 fluid oz cup of water between 7.00am and 2.30pm. 6) They then proceeded to leave our luggage at Edinburgh while we travelled to Gatwick. 7) After giving us the run around for an hour and a half they then decided to tell us they could not track our bags. 8) It then took them two days to locate them and send them from Edinburgh to Gatwick.

Too many seats makes business class cabin look crowded narrow seats with each row facing in opposite direction no problem with this but this impedes free movement for some of the seats specially the ones in the middle and window side also not much space for storage of personal items like specs etc. The window blinds of this section in upper deck were kept lowered through the entire 11 hr flight with no cue of any outside light whatsoever until we landed at Heathrow and parked to the stand felt like sitting in a light proof box with artificial illumination. I thought you need to keep the blinds open for landing and take off? The 747 business class is more comfortable than A380.,0.8

1729,2014-08-20,,British Airways customer review 18 August 2014 Gatwick to Orlando flight details and departure went well. However when the food was served on the flight there was limited choice chicken or sausages which was fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was pasta which my Father in Law doesn't eat so he ended up with 2 bread rolls as his lunch/dinner. This was served within the first hour of our over 8 hour flight and then 7 hours later we were served a snack which only had one option coronation chicken (chicken again!) which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. Again my Father in Law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. Pretty poor show British Airways as we travelled with Virgin to Mexico in June this year economy class and they offered a menu with three choices for lunch/dinner with enough for everyone! Again when the snack was served option were given and enough for all. Virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films TV and games which was something you need on a long journey again BA was not able to provide. BA your competitors are definitely offering more value for our money! I wouldn't not fly BA again as I don't like to limit my choices however I would definitely prefer to fly Virgin in future. In my opinion all flights should have enough food for all of their passengers and look at what they are offering as coronation chicken didn't go down well with a large number of passengers what's happened to good old ham or cheese?,0.1

1731,2014-08-13,,British Airways customer review I was on BA 835 from Dublin to LHR on 25th July 2014 which left Dublin at 13.05 and my travel plans were such that I had sufficient time to connect with my flight from LHR to Hong Kong. On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that BA appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings. Could do a lot better!,0.9
1732,2014-08-13,,British Airways customer review Flight BA 937 Dusseldorf to London on 13th March and BA 932 back to Dusseldorf on 15th March. Both flights served by Airbus A319. Cabin was in a good shape seat pitch 34 inch and the width 17 inch. Lounge in DUS (Airport owned Lounge) is quite nice but nothing special Lounge of BA in LHR T5 is very good with a lot of space even it was very busy at this time but anyway we know it from other times when it was quite empty. No check-in because of hand luggage only. BA 937 was delayed for about 1 hour due to foggy weather in London so the very nice staff start to serve Drinks to reduce the waiting time on ground. Brunch served after takeoff a choice between a cold platter with assorted cheese and meat and bread/rolls or a warm cheese and ham croissant and salad. Drinks including Champagne were served twice. More enough for that relatively short flight. Check-in for BA 932 (bought liquids) in T5 was very quick also friendly staff. BA Lounge as I wrote was busy but worth it to reduce waiting time. Very nice flight attendants drinks served 3 times light Dinner with mixed salad. No real Inflight Entertainment (like on most IntraEuropean Flights) small TV´s with flight information.,0.4
1733,2014-08-11,,British Airways customer review Travelled LHR-YYZ BA97 on 9 July returning BA96 28July. Check-in at LHR an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. Galleries Lounge at the south end of T5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. Outbound aircraft was G-BNLG surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. On boarding all the window shades were down (10.20 departure) and stayed down for the entire flight including take-off and landing most peculiar. The head cabin service person said it was to keep the sun out - I have questioned if this is a new BA policy for daytime flights. Departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. Food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international Business Class elsewhere. Immigration and baggage delivery in YYZ very swift. For the return again the departure formalities were quick and painless ; the lounge at Pearson is ok but nothing special. Aircraft this time was G-BGYC the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with BA's Club World seating there is little stowage space and the whole backwards/forwards concept is something I personally dislike. Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. Unfortunately it was no better than going to McDonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. Also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. Is this service policy poor seat design or lazy crew? Flight on time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. All in all the experience was what I expect from BA these days average at best.,0.9
1734,2014-08-11,,British Airways customer review Flight from Heathrow to Newark. The new Dreamliner was fantastic. Very comfortable quiet and clean. The cabin crew were superb very professional with customer service being their priority. I appreciate that flying on a new aircraft makes a difference to the flight however if BA continue to invest in their fleet and maintain and excellent level of customer service I can see no other reason to fly with another carrier especially when considering BA's avios points usage which allows all of your points to be spent on flights. Virgin however dictate how many points you can spend on each flight. I've flown with BA and Virgin many times it was a nice attempt by Virgin advertising themselves in terminal 5 however when you're sat in terminal 5 after experiencing a quick and easy run through the terminal about to board a brand new aircraft it's hard to see the advertisements working.,0.3
1735,2014-08-06,,British Airways customer review Great service from LCY-Angers in western France on Embraer 175. London City Airport is so very convenient for London dwellers and the flights were very comfortable. Saturday flight outbound was totally full but on time attentive cabin crew very comfortable and not even the breakfast of a disappointingly hard croissant with ham and cheese could spoil the positive impression. Coming back on the Wednesday was less than half-full so double drinks and snacks all round! Tickets were £120 return which seems very reasonable considering the alternative for the region is Ryanair to Tours from Stansted for almost as much and once you factor in the extra price of luggage and snacks with them BA wins hands down.,0.9

1737,2014-08-04,,British Airways customer review LIS-LHR on 30 July J class on an Airbus 320. I was expecting more however I was disappointed. Seat was OK but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor. Cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. No inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. However we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a Business Class seat. Will fly BA again but I am more keen to Intercontinental flights where the quality is superior than European routes.,0.1

A nice breakfast and dinner was served during this flight. We also received an ice cream which was very tasty. Crew was good and friendly. Only drawback are the very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour flight. We were seated on the upper deck on row 74. A very big advantage is that the seating is in a 2-4-2 configuration and the window seats have a very nice 'bin' were you can put all your stuff.,0.8
1742,2014-07-29,,British Airways customer review Round-trip with family from JFK to HYD via LHR. Onward flight was delayed at JFK by 2 hrs. Was stressful with 10 month old and a 4 yr old. Inflight service was good. Transit at LHR was a nightmare! Mile long walk after alighting to central point in Terminal 5. No gate information anywhere. Had to check-in again they had to scan each and every food item for the baby! Though departing flight was from same Terminal 5 had to now walk 30-40 yards go down a level walk again to train get off second stop go up escalator again and walk another 50 yards to last gate - C63. Now here the gate agent wouldn't let our carry on through. Said it was too big. So had to remove all baby food and items for the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carry-on. Return flight again was delayed. Had checked in at 3.30am for 6.40am flight but flight took off at 9.15am. Transit at LHR was thankfully better this time. But the aircraft to JFK was an old 747 - falling apart. No bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate us on another full flight. Old seats kept reclining on its own. A/C was blowing hot and cold until takeoff. Had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old - no luck. Never going to fly British again or pass through LHR again!,0.8

1744,2014-07-29,,British Airways customer review We flew to Rome from Newcastle via Heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at Heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home I received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in Heathrow was awful. We were left for 1 hour for someone to take us from the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take us to our flight connection so I had to push wheelchair myself.,0.7

1747,2014-07-29,,British Airways customer review DME-LHR July 23 Club World seat 64A. It was quite a novelty travelling on a 747 aircraft for a flight just over three hours long. I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing. The food and wine choices were very good and the Club Kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.,1.0
1748,2014-07-29,,British Airways customer review LHR-DME on 19 July seat 1A Club World. I flew on one of the converted A321 jets that BMI used to own and was very impressed with the seat. The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat. The service was excellent from two male crew members and the food and wine selection was of a high standard.,0.9
1749,2014-07-27,,"British Airways customer review Flew on a 777-200 from London Heathrow to San Diego worst flight I have taken on British Airways. Being a rather tall person 6'7"" and travelling in economy the person in front of me could not recline his seat due to my legs blocking his recline he complained to the cabin personnel that he could not recline and I was asked to remove my knees so he could recline stating to cabin crew that I would not have a comfortable journey they did not seem to care. When the food was served I could not even put my tray table down so the cabin crew would not serve me a meal stating that the tray must be in the down position to eat a meal. So to tell you the truth I spent the best part of 7 hours of a 11 hour flight in the toilet at least in there I could stretch out my legs. Wrote a letter to British Airways to inform them of my flight haven't heard anything back from them. Just shows you they really care about their passengers.",0.9
1750,2014-07-17,,British Airways customer review Flew GOT-LHR-LAX and back on the new A380. Flight from GOT-LHR was alright even though the flatbread they served was inedible. Transferred through T5 quick and easy. Must say that Heathrow gets better and better for every time you visit! The long haul flight on BA's A380 was excellent. I was sat on the upper deck which is a huge privilege since the seats are 2-4-2 also I was sat in a window seat which made it all even better since they've installed lockers next to the seats where you can put your stuff. The staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than I could've imagined for an economy route. The whole experience was overall better than I'd thought for a 500$ ticket and so far the best I've gone with when it comes to flights over the Atlantic.,0.5

Cabin Crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. The Club World seats are narrow and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens poor and tiny selection of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. I am amazed that British Airways standards are so low and they get away with it. This is mere A to B transport. What is missing from their Business Class is ""class"".",1.0
1752,2014-07-17,,British Airways customer review 10th July BA117 LHR-JFK. Well I have not flown with BA for a number of years as they are not my favourite airline from past experience. We were travelling with hand luggage so should be easy. Decided to not pre purchase seats but go for online check in and seat selection. All very easy and got good seats on 777-300 should have been 747 but obviously had an aircraft change. So we arrive at airport and go to security and scan our boarding cards get rejected you need to get your passport and visa validated from the BA desk before you can proceed. Would be good if this was shown on boarding pass. Boarding very good onto a new plane good seats good entertainment staff seemed interested and engaging. All the crew seemed very good. I walked off the aircraft with my view of BA restored would I fly again with them yes.,0.3
1753,2014-07-15,,British Airways customer review Flew LHR to Mumbai return with my husband - very disappointing. The Galleries lounge at Terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by BA. The food was below average. Unable to avail ourselves of the spa' facilities as they were fully booked. Not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue! We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of £240. When we boarded the aircraft (Boeing 747-400) the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. The seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. My IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole experience of BA's Club World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.,0.8
1754,2014-07-15,,British Airways customer review LHR-CPH-LHR. Business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.,0.3
1755,2014-07-15,,British Airways customer review LHR-FRA-LHR in spotlessly clean airbuses both looked brand new (although they weren't).

Only minus point is the remote stands at FRA that slow boarding and disembarkation to a snails pace.,0.6
1756,2014-07-15,,British Airways customer review Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,0.8
1757,2014-07-15,,"British Airways customer review Very disappointed with my flight back from Munich although it's only 2 hours all that was offered was a small basket consisting of a packet of nuts or shortbread. The flight over to Munich was considerably better being offered chicken curry wrap etc. We were told when booking this return in Munich that there was only one seat left however once in the aircraft there were still seats left including one next to me! However it's really the snack offered that's my main ""bone of contention"" as we chose British Airway in preference to the cheap budget airlines but we now find there's little difference in the on flight catering.",0.9
1758,2014-07-15,,British Airways customer review I flew with British Airways with my mother from Paphos to Manchester. She had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. I was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. Then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! I think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. I will never fly with BA again.,0.6

We flew on older 747 and newer 777 with latest interior - both very comfortable plenty of leg room and entertainment great. Screen on older aircraft a little small but much better on newer. Food was the best I had on any airline. Restaurant quality without a doubt.,
1760,2014-07-06,,British Airways customer review Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid £30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue if nothing else. Otherwise flight OK.,0.5
1761,2014-07-06,,British Airways customer review Flying from Aberdeen to Toronto via LHR. On board the new 787s on this route you can really notice the difference that they make over the 777. No drying of the eyes or popping of the ears thanks to the good air system. Although a little cramped in economy on the outbound journey I was able to secure a bulkhead seat on the overnight back. I would definitely recommend this as value for money over eco+. Just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from what I saw). The small commuter plane from ABZ to LHR and back was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to the 787 however the cabin crew did a great job shoehorning in a full meal service in less than an hour.,0.2

Check in opened over half an hour after stated time when a sullen agent appeared eating an apple and carrying a newspaper. She then managed to seat by wife and I in middle seats in different rows.

To make matters worse will not refund return flight of same day as on separate booking. Amazed such a big airline can't manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to Leeds to see the start of the 2014 TDF. What a disaster.,1.0
1765,2014-07-06,,British Airways customer review Travelled with my husband sister and brother inlaw to Rome via Heathrow. Yep long flight so everyone kept reminding me when I told them where we were from. Decided to upgrade to Premium Economy and thanks to our travel agent got a good deal. Several years ago I was put off from flying British Airways so thought I'd give them another go. Wasn't disappointed all flights were good considering we flew straight through to Rome I felt pretty good at the end of 30 hours in the air. The Premium Eco seats had plenty of leg room on all flights 2 bags per person even the flight from Barcelona to Gatwick which we were very grateful for. Can't say the food was anything to rave about. When the food you are eating has been on the plane as long as you have it really can't be good. Overall the flights were really good on time easy pickup of bags etc. the only disappointment is having to pay for the allocation of our seats. Apparently this is now common practice. Just be upfront about it that's all. will defiantly investigate BA again though.,0.1

The service was good but the choice of food was limited and again not what I expect from a business class experience. As for inflight entertainment? Oh dear. On a 4.5 hour flight I expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. If you didn't like the film tough. All in all I will not rush to pay the extra.,0.7

Having arrived in London on JAL after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class I had high expectations of my premiere flight in BA first. Suffice to say I won't be back. Whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats? It's crowded ugly and lacks privacy. The whole cabin - and this is 'new' first I might add - feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. The seat itself is narrow and displeasing. Crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. That sums it up really - BA is simply not offering a world-class product. I can't imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no high-profile Asian or Middle Eastern alternative available and even then I'd probably go out of my way to avoid them. I suggest that BA product managers might want to go on a world tour via Abu Dhabi Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore and try out the competition because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just don't care. There is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned for the 787-9 when it enters service with BA and I sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded ""first class"".",0.7

The CSD was not seen nor did he even come to speak with me even though I am GGL member. The only help I got was from one of the Hong Kong based air stewardesses who went out of her to help me.

My only complaint is my TV monitor was faulty and had a black line down the screen. It was not an issue as I was planning to sleep rather than watch a movie. The cabin was quieter than economy as it was at the front of the plane and I had a good 3 hours sleep. The Flight attendants were offering drinks throughout the flight which was good.

Cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. Dinner and wine/drinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner.

Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. This is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger.

Flight delayed at FCO due to storms at LHR so ample time to use the flat beds watch a film and relax. FA excellent food very good again. Overall the flights and service were superb.,1.0
1777,2014-06-20,,British Airways customer review London Heathrow to Singapore. Brand New 777-300 very comfortable very clean. Entertainment was good and food tasty but very small portions. Staff functional but not friendly only one water run in 13 hours. Arrive early so cant complain. Better than Qantas flight Singapore to Brisbane.,1.0
1778,2014-06-17,,British Airways customer review London Gatwick to Orlando. No surprises to guess that as our original flight to Tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. Due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. After finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the BA system for an unexplained reason. What an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. After accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day BA then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. Our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from Heathrow to Charlotte to Tampa. We did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for a flight instead to Orlando. A longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. We arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. To add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us! Uncomfortable claustrophobic seating cheap microwave style food cheap wine unacceptable and a waste of money.,0.7
1779,2014-06-17,,"British Airways customer review Club Europe - supposedly premium - had the misfortune of seat 1f - normally a great seat in Club Europe - but for a 4 hour flight LGW to ACE - cramped (not quite as bad as the rest of CE with new - not advertised - 30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch) - no window just a wall. Add to this limited luggage space think its EasyJet with middle seat free for £600 more. Is it worth it - no thinking avoid BA CE offering - shame I've a few flights to suffer yet. Purser - ""this is it now - get used to it"" - service downhill too.",0.1
1780,2014-06-13,,British Airways customer review BA11 LHR-SIN 11 June. This flight and the reciprocal one from Singapore to London in economy a month ago have restored my faith in BA. The aircraft was clean and in good condition; seats were comfortable staff were unfailingly attentive friendly polite and efficient. Meals were of a good standard toilets were clean and properly maintained throughout the flight. Boarding and disembarking were seamless from BA's side. One of the best flights I have had for years on many different carriers.,0.5
1781,2014-06-13,,British Airways customer review LHR to DXB 11 Jun 14 Club World Upper Deck 64A - Great flight slight delay of ten mins but excellent crew on the upper deck. Food choice is excellent and service as always of a very high standard. Not too sure about the new wash bags large draw string bag with minimal contents the wash bags get bigger but the contents get smaller! Nothing really useful in the wash bag not even eye masks or ear plugs. Useful contents would be mouth wash wet wipes etc it is about time BA looked at returning to Molton Brown which was a lot superior than the Elimis range. Otherwise a great flight met by special services on arrival in DXB who whisked me through Immigration and Customs within 20 mins of landing which exceeded all expectations.,1.0
1782,2014-06-13,,British Airways customer review Flew from Edinburgh to New York via LHR on 5th and 10 June. All flights were very full but the service from check in to on board were very good.

1784,2014-06-12,,British Airways customer review OSL-LHR June 8th. Two days after arriving I departed still less my check-in bag from June 6th. Flight delayed this is more often than not on most BA flights I have been on. Food offered in economy same Chicken Tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. I would rather have the option to buy something I might want to eat. Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but it's the only reason they have any customers.,1.0
1785,2014-06-12,,British Airways customer review BA 213 LHR to Boston. T5 was very busy but check in was fast and efficient. The flight was on a 747 the aircraft was clean but looking dated. We were seated to the rear of the aircraft. The food choice was OK but both meals had curried options fine if you like curry but limiting if you don't. Lucky for us there was still a choice. My TV was broken so I had a long 6.5 hours. The flight crew were very helpful and happy.,0.1
1786,2014-06-12,,British Airways customer review Flew World Traveller Plus for the first time. Our trip was to and from LHR from Toronto YYZ. When flying a distance World Traveller Plus is well worth the little extra. Being a big guy - tall - I really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. And the on-board staff were super. Will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. Unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at Heathrow on Friday June 6th. We made it back to Toronto OK but our luggage was just delivered to our house today Wednesday June 11th. I guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. I'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. All-in-all I will definitely fly British Airways again.,0.9
1787,2014-06-12,,British Airways customer review Glasgow to LHR on a completely full flight. The crew were amazing despite being provoked by an extremely rude lady who was sitting at the emergency exit seat they remained calm and professional despite her rude and obnoxious comments. Departed on time and landed early which is always nice.,0.7
1788,2014-06-12,,British Airways customer review LHR-CPH-LHR both A320s. Other than bussed to stand on the outward all was very good. The bus is unexpected at a 'new' terminal but the warmth of the welcome from the crew cheered you up a lot! Simple and tasty flatbread and drink ideal for the 1.45 journey. The return was a tad delayed due local ATC but even though only 10 mins or so the flight deck kept us very well informed and the crew came round with juice or water. Delay was made up enroute and bag appeared as I reached the carousel. Advance booking and using a few points (some I earned back on this flight) made the fare cheaper than low cost carriers. With BA renewing it's fleet the a/c seemed almost new and all very enjoyable.,1.0

1790,2014-06-08,,British Airways customer review LHR-SIN in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say about this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less. Would not recommend.,0.5
1791,2014-06-08,,British Airways customer review LHR to BOS. Day after baggage shut down but First check in easy and security quiet. Super breakfast in Concorde Room. Flight then delayed for 2 hours whilst all on board but crew were great. Food and wine superb and service was BA at it's very best.,0.2
1792,2014-06-08,,British Airways customer review LHR-ARN. All the procedures at Heathrow terminal 5 were a breeze. There was some kind of baggage delivery failure at check-in but the staff managed it very well smiling and being professional. The flight went on an old dirty and worn out A319 though seats were comfortable. The service was of typical intra European flight: light cold snacks and drinks flight attendants were professional. Overall I would use BA in the future but I would prefer flying a newer plane next time.,0.9
1793,2014-06-08,,British Airways customer review LGW to AMS. Easy check-in at Gatwick with the pods to check in and print boarding pass. Did that the night before as staying at an airport hotel. Easy and quick to drop off bag. Departure lounge easy to find. Controlled boarding. Pleasant staff and light snack on short flight. Well recommended and far better to use than T5 at LHR if you have the choice. Luggage took a long time to arrive at AMS but that is Schipol's issue rather than BA.,0.6
1794,2014-06-08,,British Airways customer review I really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight too (and from) Vegas was with BA however I can categorically state I will never fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive a superior option as an airline. Highlights of my journey include: Severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. Delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. Running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (No beer 1 hr in to flight - after the 90 minute delay). Uninterested and incompetent staff. Lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). Space reduced to less than a foot (Head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. I could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when I say that I am an easy customer to please. If you have Virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please take my word for it and go with them they are a class apart. BA operate as a (poor) budget airline posing as something else. Very poor journey shocking experience.,1.0
1795,2014-06-08,,British Airways customer review Flew in Club World for the first time on the new BA A380s. Big disappointment. The two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. The dinner service on the LHR-JNB flight was chronically slow (about three hours from beginning to end). The staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals. All this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. The cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers. A pity as the planes are quieter than previous generation aircraft and the flight was very smooth.,0.1
1796,2014-06-05,,British Airways customer review LHR-ATH-ATH June 2014. Both flights 1.5 hours late which always seems to be the case largely due to the old plane (767) used on this particular flight. Food average cabin crew variable-average overall. No apologies for lateness of flights which unacceptable-BA still seem to think that they are doing you a favour for letting you fly with them. Poor overall and am even considering using Easyjet as Gatwick closer to my home.,0.4
1797,2014-06-04,,British Airways customer review LHR to BKK in club world over night flight. Lounge at T5 great. Nice choice of hot foods wines and snacks. Love the spa treatments. I really like the club world seats very private for sleeping. Food tasty had mushroom pasta. Good choice of films. Most of crew in club did a great job still get the odd one here and there that are surly and disinterested - make you feel as if they are doing you a favour! I always try and fly BA on the whole a great airline.,0.2
1798,2014-06-04,,British Airways customer review Sao Paulo - London Heathrow Club World. Sat in the upper deck on the 747. Fantastic experience. Very comfortable flight with attentive helpful cabin crew. Reasonable food good selection of drinks and good IFE.,0.7
1799,2014-06-04,,British Airways customer review Travelled from Barbados to London Gatwick and then onwards to Italy using British Airways in both instances. Returned to Gatwick on May 28 and again travelled by BA to Barbados. My experience in all instances was extremely positive. The flight crew on all flights accommodated my every request. The food was served at the right temperature at appropriate intervals and was tasty. I would definitely use this airline again.,0.9
1800,2014-06-01,,British Airways customer review A long time user of BA I have seen a gradual decline in quality now hit freefall and the LHR-PHX-LHR route that I use monthly has become more akin to sitting in a cattle truck than a B747. Old airframes with tatty interiors are the norm legroom is extremely limited the aircraft is seldom what you would call clean and the crews give the impression they are almost putting themselves out to serve you. Food is not worthy of the name and the whole experience is an utterly miserable 10 hours of your life each leg. Enough is enough and 1st June is the last time I'll use the outbound flight as I'm switching across to United via ORD in future. OK it means a changeover in Chicago but the recent experience was a refreshing change from BA and I actually felt like I was wanted on the United flights.,0.5
1801,2014-06-01,,British Airways customer review LHR-Warsaw. Economy on an A320. Plane seemed brand new. Was seated in 8C towards the front of Economy and that's obviously a seat that gets configured for Club Europe from time to time as the seat pitch was pretty generous. Complimentary breakfast consisting of coffee and a filled croissant was perfectly OK. Service efficient. Flight left and landed on time. Textbook stuff really. No complaints at all.,0.2
1802,2014-05-29,,"British Airways customer review Boeing 767 Club Europe to Istanbul and back. The seats were tatty and very worn leg room limited at best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not recline their seats. The head rests are hanging off as are parts of the cabin. The food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great. Even though I know they do that in the galley in first class it doesn't need to be on display. Crew much better inbound.",0.9
1803,2014-05-28,,British Airways customer review Gatwick-Tampa. Check in simple lounge at Gatwick average aircraft B777. Clean and departed on time. On board pleasant welcome food just about ok after some research chose seat 4K window you won't disturb anyone getting out. But have to agree with mostly everyone else that seats are small and facing a stranger is quite odd. Cabin crew excellent flight crew informative through out the flight which landed on time. Anyone booking Business as opposed to Eco or Eco plus should know that all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat seat and allowance of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in Eco. Good films to choose from but music naff as is the screen. Brought my own in ear Bose IQ20 headset Excellent for flights.,0.5
1804,2014-05-28,,British Airways customer review My husband and I travelled to San Diego from Heathrow and back via JFK five weeks later. Service is appalling. Stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. Food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to San Diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. Dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. The problem is staff. There needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain.,0.7
1805,2014-05-27,,British Airways customer review I flew on Apr 29 to Belfast changing in Heathrow and also May 6th from Belfast to (via Heathrow) Barcelona then May 17 from Venice - Heathrow) then to Vancouver BC. I was very pleased with the service and meals and flight attendants were great. The only part was that changing at Heathrow was a bit of a pain having to wait to see on the board re what gate to go to but otherwise everything was great.,0.3
1806,2014-05-27,,British Airways customer review I found BA to be the worst airline I have used. Flew LHR to Boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. Cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. Also leg room appalling with trim falling of the seat in front of me. It had the interior of an old knackered plane. I have flown Singapore Airlines who run rings around this bunch. I could have flown with Virgin instead for the same money and would have had a vastly superior less drab experience.,0.6
1807,2014-05-27,,"British Airways customer review Heathrow - Johannesburg A380. My first flight on A380. After half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started. First thing I noticed was how tiny the seats were. Second thing to notice is that the plane was not properly cleaned. There were grease stains and empty cans left behind. At this point I noticed some toilet paper between the panels above my head. When asked the cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation problem from the air conditioning. Anyhow time for lift off. I turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at the tail of the plane. After looking for 5 minutes I couldn't find it anywhere. (Later I found out there is no such option on BA A380s). So no tail cam fine let's listen to some music. Wrong the headphones are not working. Cabin crew assures me they will ""bring me some more"". One hour later suffice it to say cabin crew did not bring anything. I've managed to grab a pair of unused headphones from one empty seat just to find out they were not working either. Probably it was some problem with the jack in the seat rendering the whole inflight entertainment system pointless. And if that was not enough it was time for dinner. By the time it was my turn BA had run out of ""chicken"" so my dinner was asparagus with rice or something like that. You don't even have to look at it to understand why everyone else was choosing the ""chicken"". So no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. Pretty much spent the rest of the journey counting the minutes until I could get off this plane. The worst part is I have a return trip with BA which I'll be looking to switch to another airline if possible.",0.1
1808,2014-05-26,,British Airways customer review Club Europe London Heathrow T3 to Lisbon. T3 lounge very good. Boarding fine and helpful but it is disappointing that this flight consistently requires a bus to link the terminal to the plane and that there is no specific service for Club Europe passengers. There is little point in fast tracking us at other stages of the journey to ignore us at this point. Good flight excellent cabin crew - why can't BA have a consistency of cabin crew quality? Today's crew were excellent - attentive engaged appropriately friendly and amusing and consistent with their service throughput the flight. Food was fine champagne improved from previous flights. Quality of cabin still modest - upgrade of the cabins really should be a priority but I fear that BA's focus is on the long haul not those of us who travel within Europe. Efficient upon arriving at Lisbon.,0.2
1809,2014-05-26,,British Airways customer review Heathrow - Johannesburg. Concorde lounge comfortable as always. A little underwhelmed at first by first class on the A380 not as spacious or appealing as I had expected. However it had all that I needed including a very good screen for the IFE. Had the 5-course taster menu but different wines than those which were suggested. Was very good indeed did not have the dessert but the better half pronounced it outstanding. Unfortunately arrived at same time as several other long-haul flights so immigration was a pain but not much BA can do about that.,0.8
1810,2014-05-18,,British Airways customer review When we booked our holiday to Barbados I was really pleased to see we were flying with British Airways as they have a good reputation. Sadly our experiences put a lie to this. As part of the service they offer BA allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. I tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. After a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator (whose grasp of English wasn't great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than “keep trying”. I rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other than a better grasp of English was still unable to assist in any way. Both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the Airport. So in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. We entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on the same row. By now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! We then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually we're allocated 2 seats together. As they were free I don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? I have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. Sadly British Airways don't appear to follow this doctrine. The legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat I had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. As my TV screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. I managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so I was forced to stop. I would love to see what regulations BA have to follow regarding VDU viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. The final disappointment came when the food was distributed. I had the Thai Chicken which was over-cooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. She didn't eat hers. I ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. All in all this was an experience I do not want to repeat and I shall certainly not fly British Airways by choice in the future! We didn't have these problems with Sri Lanka Airlines.,0.5
1811,2014-05-18,,British Airways customer review LGW-Antigua on 29 April and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It started off badly when I went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 February. The system rejected both my credit and debit cards. On checking the state of my account with BA online I found that the final payment had been credited to my account and I now owed the initial deposit. I sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. First call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of English. Another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. I was told it had been sorted out and received E ticket email with my state of account showing I owed nothing. Two weeks later I received another E ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. Next credit card statement did not show money taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. Two weeks before flight I got a phone call from BA stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. I then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. About 22 hours before flight I went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. Arrived at LGW to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. We then had to queue to drop off baggage. Other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. Flight left and arrived on time. However the inflight main meal was the worst I have ever experienced on an aircraft. There was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. The inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to Singapore in 1962 was better. On return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. Check in at Antigua was one of the quickest check ins I have ever done. Left Antigua on time and arrived LGW on time. Food was worse than going out. No choice. Starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. Main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. White wine was just about drinkable. Coffee served as we started main course. Asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty. At least with Ryanair you know what you get for your money.,0.1
1812,2014-05-18,,British Airways customer review LHR-JTR-LHR. A tale of opposites for BA's new route to Santorini. Outward it couldn't have been better with excellent FAs decent food and arrival that was ahead of schedule. The return started off poorly with substandard facilities at Santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge and no priority boarding. An air traffic controller issue kept the plane grounded for 30 minutes. On board they'd forgotten the menus for the dinner service and the starter and cheese course had been left behind. The Club Europe toilet then ran out of water. So overall okay but the return was disappointing.,0.2
1813,2014-05-17,,British Airways customer review Travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children) from London to Boston I hoped there wouldn't be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. I had not paid to reserve my seat as I had never had to pay extra before while flying with Emirates Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left (A/B/C). My wife sat with the kids while I had to sit in the row behind. The seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. It seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. I warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. I had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. On the return flight I reluctantly paid extra (£23 x 4) to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. The journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldn't recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs (he should have paid and extra £23 and reserved a seat with more leg room). My wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. In conclusion I found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing. It seems the flight services to USA are not up to the same standard as flying to the Middle East or the Far East as British Airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier - my last experience to the USA was with American Airlines and that was worse than BA. The main disappointing issue with BA is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. If you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra £200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of Ryanair!,0.6
1814,2014-05-15,,British Airways customer review LCY-SNN-JFK-LCY BA001 and 004. Quick check in and fast track security although I had to show my boarding pass to get expedited. Gate 24 lounge with a view of our aircraft and a glass of champagne. Quick boarding nice welcome by a familiar face. Cabin has stood up well and is as fresh as it was on introduction. Starter choice to Shannon now replaced by a selection of canapes served on a plate. USA immigration straight forward and soon back on the aircraft but the airport is soulless. Once in the air salad drinks and a choice of mains. I had the curry which was excellent followed by chocolate fondant smothered in chocloate sauce - bliss. Later on the Friday 001 flight which departs at 1245 as opposed to 0945 they serve supper rather than afternoon tea. This was a plate of cold cuts and samosas.Tasty.Quick disembarkation lovely crew. Return on 004 Sunday evening supper in the busy Galleries dining room. then quick boarding on this full 31/32 flight. Supper served to those who wanted it and then a full hot English breakfast option or a bag to go. Bussed to the arrivals hall and immigration and then home in 15 minutes. Excellent crew and flight.,0.3

1816,2014-05-15,,British Airways customer review Flew to Vegas on 8th May and dismayed at the standard. Filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. Only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. Sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative; we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did (around row 31) as it normally happened. The worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.,0.8
1817,2014-05-13,,British Airways customer review On a recent vacation from Sacramento to Paris some friends and I had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from Paris to Sacramento. We did however choose British Airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. I am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. I will definitely recommend British Airways for International flights to my friends.,0.2
1818,2014-05-12,,British Airways customer review I should be in a nice hotel in Romania instead 9 hours after I arrived in Heathrow courtesy of British Airways I am still in Heathrow heading back to Glasgow! The 7am flight went well 10/10 for getting me from Glasgow to London. The connecting flight to Bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant I wouldn't get my connecting flight to Timisoara. I duly went to customer services (waited 50 mins) who offered to get me to Timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9/5/14 was fully booked. They offered to put me up in a hotel in Bucharest but were not able to book one. Having waited 50 mins at a BA desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in Bucharest I was not filled with confidence. Since I was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting I decided to go back to Glasgow. I was booked on the 15.50 to Glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. Told my boarding pass was sorted. They hadn't sorted it and I got a lecture about what I needed to do in future. There was no way I was getting on the flight told that I should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. Told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again!,0.7
1819,2014-05-11,,British Airways customer review LHR-FRA-LCY May 2014. LHR-FRA on a 767 row 18. Checked-in via the mobile app no bags to drop as a day trip. BA Galleries South for a quick spot of breakfast. Boarding started 20 minutes before departure. Not a full flight. Left slightly late due to cargo being loaded but arrived on time. Standard seating and food for BA short haul European flight. Return FRA-LCY on a E70 Row 15. Use of the JAL lounge at FRA opposite the gate area. Bus to the aircraft and an on-time departure. Full flight and not much room up above for carry on items on this aircraft on a full flight. Legroom quite tight in row 15. Again standard food and drink for a BA short haul service.,0.1
1820,2014-05-08,,British Airways customer review I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.,0.5
1821,2014-05-07,,British Airways customer review LGW-VRN-LGW both in Club Europe. Was offered an upgrade on the way out for £85. Swift check-in as Gatwick was quiet at 6.30am. Used the Galleries lounge-reasonable cold food selection but the only hot option was porridge. Nice atmosphere though and good views of the runway. Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of food-nothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm! The lounge is before the security check so not able to relax altogether. Crew very apologetic about delay speedy drinks and meal service-the chicken curry was passable.,0.2
1822,2014-05-07,,British Airways customer review 6 May 2014: Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777. Back on BA again thanks to Avios Companion coupon. Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. I've flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content. Yesterdays offering for Breakfast was almost an insult.,0.7
1823,2014-05-07,,British Airways customer review LHR-YYZ in business was looking forward to a B787 but this flight was a B777. Had the rear facing seat- comfortable enough but it is always awkward trying to clamber over the passenger seated diagonally opposite. Enjoyed the plentiful supply of pink champagne. Lunch was fine as was the afternoon tea. IFE screen on the small side but managed one movie. Crew were pleasant friendly and efficient.,0.5
1824,2014-05-07,,"British Airways customer review Lanzarote to Gatwick on 13th April. Flight itself was okay but on arrival we were ""parked"" a long way from the baggage reclaim area (for which the Captain apologised). After a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. Many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. BA have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from ""start to finish"" but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. Can't recommend BA because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. Not planning to use BA again because of this.",0.8
1825,2014-05-06,,"British Airways customer review I'm not normally one to whine but here goes. LHR-CDG at 0725 on a Tuesday morning via the dreaded gate A10. Plenty of ""Fast Track"" signage and we fast trackers were herded through the checkpoint onto a bus where we waited until we were joined by all the other passengers! Outstanding! Flight OK (fairly grubby ex BD A320) but the pointlessness of a non fast Fast Track amused me no end.",0.1
1826,2014-05-06,,British Airways customer review JFK to LHR. Empty check in and priority security quick. New food selection in First class lounge but preferred the decent meal in the dining room. Boarding easy and upper deck crew excellent as lights not turned on until just before descent with arrival on time. Bus to terminal but bags waiting when we got there.,0.6
1827,2014-05-05,,British Airways customer review Chicago O'Hare to London Heathrow on 2 May. check in very fast and efficient. New 777 plane. Take off and landing about 30 minutes late. Friendly flight crew. Efficient service. Good vegetarian meal. Very pleasant flight.,0.7
1828,2014-05-04,,British Airways customer review Travelled to HKG on board the new A380. Boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for First passengers. Welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. The space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast was also very good. I managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product. Plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. I couldn't fault this flight just a pity I couldn't spend longer on it. Looking forward to the return journey.,1.0
1829,2014-05-03,,"British Airways customer review BA 059 London to Cape Town April 29 2014 economy. It's been a while since I flew BA world traveller and it will be even longer until I use them again. Clapped out 747 terrible uncomfortable seats awful back of seat video system. - my partners failed. The crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more interested in getting the ""service"" note the quotes over with ASAP. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip. Perfunctory drinks service - when asking for a whisky and soda I was offered whisky and tonic. Paper cups for coffee at breakfast. Meals are better at a Little Chef. The amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush. Never again. Wake up BA there are major competitors out there and next time it Emirates via Dubai.",1.0
