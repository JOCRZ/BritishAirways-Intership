0,Kane Kelly (United Kingdom) 5th October 2023,5/10,"""British Airways was absolutely shocking""","Not Verified |  Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers. Oh and don't bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your money off you and give you nothing back."
1,Gary Storer (United Kingdom) 3rd October 2023,1/10,"""service was mediocre at best""","Not Verified | Just returned from Chicago, flew out 10 days ago on American Airlines absolutely superb in every way, had high expectations on return flight with BA. What a disappointment. The Airbus A380 may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful. Very uncomfortable seats, the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight, the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best. Our short flight from Heathrow to Manchester was much improved, very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early. In future we will travel with one of the American carriers."
2,A Jensen (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2023,2/10,"""BA standards continue to decline""","✅ Trip Verified |  BA standards continue to decline every time I fly with them. This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided."
3,John Rockett (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2023,2/10,"""won the race to the bottom""","Not Verified |  Awful. Business class check in queue just as long as for economy, probably because half of the desks were not staffed and Terminal 5 is chaotic. Business lounge overfull, couldn't get seats. Delayed flight, unmanaged chaos at the gate. No drink on boarding, first drink served an hour after take-off. The meal was poor, used to get better in economy on other airlines. British Airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes. Not looking forward to the flight home."
4,Tatiana Bobrovskaya (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2023,2/10,"""Not a reliable airline""","✅ Trip Verified |  Not a reliable airline. You cannot trust the timing at all. I had a 6.45am flight, boarding was on time, but then we are sitting in the plane for already (1.5 hours) and the expected departure is still not clear. They have discovered the engine is not working! I am risking to be late for a business meeting in Geneva. How come they bring a not working plane to the gate. The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress. In the end, on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 1.5 hours and I have missed the meeting. I thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time, but today I see it's routine for BA not to fly on time."
5,A Dawson (United Kingdom) 30th September 2023,3/10,"""It is a national disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified |  I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I'm not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curry. Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn't check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being 'bumped' to economy. This airline fails to deliver time and time again. It is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative."
6,Massimo Garavaglia (Italy) 30th September 2023,1/10,"""The worst journey in my life""","✅ Trip Verified |  The worst journey in my life. The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost. I filled the form and gave to the employee. I was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference number. BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address. I had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty website. They delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt. I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC. Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BA. Never again!"
7,Tom Slowbe (United States) 28th September 2023,3/10,"""Very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | The airplanes and the lounges are worn out, old and broken. From Dallas to Heathrow, multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed. The first class seating from Heathrow to Dubrovnik was nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticket. Very disappointed."
8,E Anderson (United Kingdom) 28th September 2023,4/10,"""the service was shockingly bad""","✅ Trip Verified | One of the worst experiences on the worst airline. The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues. The time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled. There was zero information given. Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight. Overall the service was shockingly bad, the worst I have experienced from any airline. I will not ever use them again."

C Horden (United Kingdom) 27th September 2023",1/10,"""Never again will I fly BA""","✅ Trip Verified |  Cancelled our flight last-minute then moved us onto a flight 2 days later operated by Japan Airlines. We had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as I am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane. Because it was operated by a different airline but booked by BA, neither BA nor the other airline could change my seat over the phone despite seats being available. After 4 hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport. I did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online. I got a £10 meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a 14 hour flight. Never again will I fly BA. I would rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again."
10,Peter Costello (United Kingdom) 11th September 2023,5/10,"""service on board was impeccable""","✅ Trip Verified | Despite boarding being the usual free for all at LHR with groups 1-3 being called to board all at once. Whilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a bag in at the gate, getting to board before anyone else! However, the service on board was impeccable. Superb crew, friendly, attentive, interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their job. Like BA in the old days and at its best. Food choice and quality seems to have improved too (no beef cheeks thankfully) and even the Club kitchen appears to have returned. Old style Club seating, but is at least better, and feels less cramped, on the 787's."
11,Brent Davies (United Kingdom) 10th September 2023,8/10,"""a national disgrace""","Not Verified |  Flight cancelled, no crew! 9th September 2023, not peak holiday period so why such bad management by BA? Sent to the gate left standing of over and hour and then flight cancelled. As were other on that day. Why does BA continue to provide such poor service - a national disgrace."
12,Angie Rodrigues (Kuwait) 9th September 2023,1/10,"""The worst service ever""","Not Verified |  The worst service ever, my baggage did not arrive on time. Both my flights were delayed. I will never fly them again.  Even the food was bad and your service."
13,E Durken (Germany) 6th September 2023,1/10,"""Cannot recommend""",✅ Trip Verified |  4/4 flights we booked this holiday were delayed about 1-2 hours. No wifi available on 2 of 4 flights Food and drinks very basic and expensive. Cannot recommend
14,N Gassel (United Kingdom) 4th September 2023,1/10,"""BA is worse than a low cost carrier""","✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now."

Rajan Parrikar (Iceland) 4th September 2023",1/10,"""less than a premium experience""","✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights. The seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on British Airways the Business Class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft. This makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboard. The WiFi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds. But when it worked it was surprisingly fast. Service on this flight was very good and we got to Keflavik on time."

Rajan Parrikar (Iceland) 4th September 2023",8/10,"""good, but not spectacular""","✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777-200. This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I've seen on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn't an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time. In summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product."
17,S Dateen (United Kingdom) 4th September 2023,8/10,"""Lies and misleading unprofessional service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Care and support shocking. Written by a previously loyal BA traveller. Lies and misleading unprofessional service. Told that my flight was cancelled. Booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy. Called to ask why. Told technical fault with my original flight. My suspicion was another reason. At airport, check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day. Why take my money and allow me to book a flight which would have allowed me to get to work as a doctor in the first place! How can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer."
18,R H (Australia) 2nd September 2023,2/10,"""avoid BA like the plague""",✅ Trip Verified |  Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.
19,May Porter (United Kingdom) 1st September 2023,1/10,"""British Airways absolutely does not care""","✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways absolutely does not care. My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awful. After enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. No water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier. I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service. My last trip to London was with Delta, they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become."
20,Tine Ditmar Unnerup (Denmark) 25th August 2023,5/10,"""Never again, BA""","✅ Trip Verified |  In June my flight was cancelled within three hours of departure. Was given a rebooking the next day and they lost my suitcase. It arrived three days later. Today - 25th August 2023 - it happened again. Offer of rebooking in two days. When trying to post a claim, the website doesn't work. Never again, BA."

S Marakides (United Kingdom) 24th August 2023",1/10,"""ravioli pasta had dried out""","✅ Trip Verified |  Ground and cabin crew always provide good customer service. When it comes to catering, Club Class has been reduced to what Economy was. On flight BA621, the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edges. My slice of Camembert was dried- why bother serving it? My bread roll, white olive bread, was dry. I wonder whether anyone in BA monitors that. Club class has become Economy when you get crying babies and noisy children in Club class.  Now it’s a glorified, soulless bus trip, without Britishness."
22,S Brydon (United States) 19th August 2023,4/10,"""Great customer service""","✅ Trip Verified |  My family flew from Washington to London on a British Airways A380, we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee. Our flight was unfortunately delayed by 2 hrs from 2245 to 0120 causing us to miss a connection from Gatwick to Turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport. Onboard I sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff. In flight entertainment system didn’t work very well, the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use, it could use updating. The food for dinner was decent, they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards. The seat was pretty comfortable, and the flight was smooth. After we missed our connection and we’re stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts, they rebooked us on a flight from Heathrow to Milan the next day, gave us free bus tickets to Heathrow, gave us a free hotel room, and gave us Dinner and Breakfast vouchers. Great customer service!"
23,E Smyth (United Kingdom) 13th August 2023,7/10,"""Cabin crew were all fantastic""","✅ Trip Verified |  Easy check in a T5. Galleries south and North lounges packed, only just able to get a seat. Didn’t stay long as B gates lounge much quieter. Flight boarded smoothly and on time. A380 upper deck. Old club world seating which is beginning to age a little. However, like the large toilets on this aircraft type. Cabin crew were all fantastic. One family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without success. Food and drink options were all very good. Entertainment was good. Overall an enjoyable flight."
24,D Daly (United States) 12th August 2023,8/10,"""asked us to check our bags""","Not Verified |  Flight delayed by an hour, it happens, no biggie. Had us change our gate at the airport, never happened before but I guess it's ok. Gate agent asked us to check our bags and after telling him we would prefer not to do that, he did it anyway. Second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for 6'3"" travel bud."
25,Karima Saci (United Kingdom) 11th August 2023,2/10,"""service is extremely poor""",Not Verified | The staff are very rude and not trained properly. No exceptions are made for children and elderly people. The price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poor
26,S Deynal (United Kingdom) 8th August 2023,2/10,"""superior to mainline British Airways""",✅ Trip Verified |  Good domestic flight operated by BA Cityflyer. Ground service at check-in Edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpful. The flight departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. A complimentary drink and snack (albeit tiny!) were served. Generally it seems that the quality of the Cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline British Airways flights.
27,Branko Stolz (Canada) 8th August 2023,10/10,"""Staff quite unpleasant""",Not Verified | Failed at all basic travel fundamentals: 1) Our flight was delayed. 2) Staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance. The fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored. 3) Staff were quite unpleasant.
28,G Maysev (Poland) 8th August 2023,1/10,"""They lost my baggage""","✅ Trip Verified |  They lost my baggage in a very simple situation. It's been three weeks and they don't care, no communication whatsoever. I was at the connection checkpoint at Heathrow 3hrs before my connecting flight, the last leg of my trip. An agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full. And then they lose it. I claim it at the arrival airport immediately. Now it's been three weeks, no communication whatsoever, the online status is still “Searching for your bag” with no updates. My conclusion is that the BA males no effort to find my missing bag and they don't care."

R Heirten (United Kingdom) 5th August 2023",1/10,"""leaving two hours late""",✅ Trip Verified |  Late boarding led to a one hour flight leaving two hours late. A single BA staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart. There had been no previous announcement of the delay. Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.
30,B McIver (Germany) 21st July 2023,5/10,"""Zero empathy was shown""","✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily."
31,D Keane (United Kingdom) 21st July 2023,1/10,"""pilot apologise at every step of the way""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time."
32,Alan Lacey (United Kingdom) 20th July 2023,4/10,"""crew were always ready to top up drinks""","Not Verified |  Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the ""chocolate and orange pot"" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can't afford it?"
33,K Malec (United Kingdom) 20th July 2023,8/10,"""The service is really mediocre""","✅ Trip Verified |  I don't understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience."
34,Alan Lacey (United Kingdom) 20th July 2023,2/10,"""made their economy experience so miserable""","Not Verified |  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc."
35,N Hancock (United Kingdom) 18th July 2023,2/10,"""Customer Service does not exist""","✅ Trip Verified |  Customer Service does not exist. One world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no”. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Delayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original time. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Back on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn’t be, round and round. Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out flight left 2 hours delayed. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets!"
36,Steven Hodgson (United Kingdom) 17th July 2023,1/10,"""another great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Another really great pair of flights, on time, no problems at all, champagne was ok and my meal choices were great, the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat, in flight entertainment could have been better, can’t wait to fly with BA again and enjoy another great experience."
37,John Grainger (United Kingdom) 17th July 2023,9/10,"""Not recommended""","Not Verified |  Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended."
38,K Robson (United Kingdom) 16th July 2023,1/10,"""5 hours and 30 mins but no meal""",Not Verified | Horrible airline. Does not care about their customers. Used to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn't even offer juices. I would stick with another airline.
39,Pradeep Madhavan (United Kingdom) 9th July 2023,2/10,"""Things have really deteriorated""","✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them."

Ralph Tuckwell (United Kingdom) 29th June 2023",5/10,"""preferred to fly on easyJet""","Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA."
41,N Beale (United Kingdom) 27th June 2023,2/10,"""stated it is not their fault""","✅ Trip Verified |  After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. When attempting to collect my luggage, mine was the only one not to arrive. I sought help and was informed to make a claim online. When my bag finally arrived 7 days later, the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. Someone emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about, I felt violated. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish. For a month, I have been back and forth to British Airways, yet they stated it is not their fault."
42,T Casey (United States) 27th June 2023,1/10,"""luggage was mis-tagged in Dallas""","✅ Trip Verified |  My luggage was mis-tagged in Dallas on my way to Cairo via London. My Luggage arrived at LHR as planned on Saturday 6/24. However, upon arrival due to the luggage being mis-tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage, it was never sent to Cairo. Its sitting in Terminal 3 in LHR (I have an air tag on my luggage) and British Airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it. I have filed 3 claims, made 13 phone calls, have been hung up on 3x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at BA refuse to solve the problem."
43,Paige Boet (United States) 25th June 2023,1/10,"""The airline lost my luggage""","✅ Trip Verified |  The airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip. They gave me no updates, their website sucks, and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone. They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to the US. Now, I’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me. They appease me on the phone, tell me they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up. Several times, when I called I got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call back later”."
44,S Layne (United States) 25th June 2023,1/10,"""fully refunded by our travel insurance""","✅ Trip Verified |  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance."
45,E Lanewoski (United Kingdom) 25th June 2023,1/10,"""no boarding drinks provided""","✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying with BA business class, never again. There are no boarding drinks provided. My meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine. On arrival at Bodrum my bags were among the last to appear. Not looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight."
46,Joel Burman (United Kingdom) 24th June 2023,2/10,"""WiFi didn't work""","Not Verified | You can buy sandwiches and crisps but don't expect a hot meal. Because the plane is a narrow body , there are no screens. Not helping matters is the fact that the BA prebooking shop for food didn't recognise the flight number, and the onboard  WiFi didn't work."
47,R Vines (United Kingdom) 24th June 2023,4/10,"""stick with economy""","✅ Trip Verified |  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy."
48,M King (United States) 23rd June 2023,7/10,"""Communication is terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely horrible airline. Communication is terrible. Last minute delays, cancellations, seat changes with no communication. App and website user experience is years behind other airlines. Seats are cramped and uncomfortable. Overpriced. Would not fly again."

50,K Pickering (United States) 8th June 2023,5/10,"""I will never fly British Airways again""","✅ Trip Verified |  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either."
51,M Johnson (United Kingdom) 7th June 2023,1/10,"""All in all very disappointing""",✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I booked seats within our premium economy booking. On both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served food. Each time they had run out of our choices. On one occasion I did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me. On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food. All in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of British Airways.
52,Benjamin Stevens (United States) 6th June 2023,4/10,"""customer service was horrendous""","Not Verified |  May 3, flew from Seattle to Heathrow then to Edinburgh. BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes, club rentals, tees, balls. I had tee times at two courses in St. Andrews that took months to make. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. I contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletries. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservation. They rebooked me on the same flight. BA customer service was horrendous and make false promises. I will never use this airlines again. Beware of British Airways. They also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members."
53,V Samaras (Greece) 6th June 2023,1/10,"""All flights without exception were delayed""","✅ Trip Verified | I went through three flights to reach my destination. All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they weren't prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't communicate properly with them. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. I contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn't address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me. 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline together though."
54,Christopher Neep (United Kingdom) 6th June 2023,2/10,"""An excellent flight""","✅ Trip Verified | An excellent flight in Club World on British Airways. The welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight. The crew were attentive, friendly and very professional. On board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines. In flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio. The seat/flat bed was very comfortable - British Airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the A350. I liked the sleek, minimalist design. This flight showed that BA can be among the world’s best airlines."
55,Ali Balandy (Canada) 5th June 2023,9/10,"""luggage was still in London""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight schedule was delayed for one hour. After boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutes. When we arrived in London, we were delayed again for at least another 30 minutes to find a gate. We were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight. When we arrived at Barcelona airport, we discovered that our check in luggage was still in London. Very painful trip (disrupted our vacation). Not flying with BA anymore if I can find alternative Airlines."
56,A Robinson (United States) 3rd June 2023,3/10,"""worst experience in all my years of travel""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst experience in all my years of travel. My first flight with my two kids from Boston to London was delayed by 2 hours, resulting in me missing my connecting flight. Despite having a layover of approximately 2.5 hours, I ended up waiting until 4.30 pm to board my flight to Cairo. Unfortunately, even that flight was delayed. I would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline, even if it means paying a bit more for a different option."
57,K Parker (Australia) 3rd June 2023,1/10,"""The worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  The worst experience in all my years of travel. Bag was destroyed, flight delayed 3 hours and couldn't get water on board. Then when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that wouldn't work.

59,Christos Hadjipanayi (Cyprus) 1st June 2023,2/10,"""the crew has helped me""",✅ Trip Verified |  A serious medical problem appeared while I was onboard. I informed the crew and they helped me out. Unfortunately I was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell I became. Also I could not find my way back home in my condition. Thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until I returned back home. It was a stressful experience but the crew of British Airways made it way more tolerable.
60,E Heale (United States) 17th May 2023,5/10,"""Absolutely terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience. The app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did not accept them even when provided. I was trying to fly back to the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors. I went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plenty of time. This was also during an industrial action at Heathrow, meaning the number of flights were limited. I was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the USA, all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport."
61,H Mike  (United Kingdom) 17th May 2023,1/10,"""poor service and unhappy customers""",✅ Trip Verified | BA overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer. It means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage. Makes easyJet and Ryanair look like customer champions. The server in Itsu in the BA terminal says she stopped flying BA years ago due to the service being bad all the time. Most customers she serves have a complaint Staff don't care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.
62,Richard Cruise (United Kingdom) 17th May 2023,1/10,"""just won't use them again""","✅ Trip Verified |  
The flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never is. The Staff were efficient. My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. So ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. The seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again."
63,Kathi Blanning (United States) 14th May 2023,1/10,"""Another bad show""","Not Verified | Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn’t positive. Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business class fare should offer more."

Harry Okin (United Kingdom) 14th May 2023",3/10,"""what an earth is going on at BA""","✅ Trip Verified | I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great."
65,Nicholas Felty (United States) 13th May 2023,3/10,"""I had to reschedule my flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me. I've lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show."
66,C Peale (Australia) 8th May 2023,1/10,"""most appalling airline service""","✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways."

68,S Dasirou (United Kingdom) 6th May 2023,1/10,"""Avoid this airline""",✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. Avoid this airline. It’s now becoming regular practice to cancel flights. Had a cancellation from Switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to Spain.

69,Alexander George (United Kingdom) 1st May 2023,1/10,"""a lot of actual lies being told""","✅ Trip Verified |  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better. There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told. You can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they say. All of them are better suited to working away from other humans."
70,M Edwards (United Kingdom) 16th April 2023,5/10,"""relentless BA cost cutting""","✅ Trip Verified |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping."
71,Luis Rojas (United Kingdom) 15th April 2023,4/10,"""I wouldn't recommend British Airways""","✅ Trip Verified |  I wouldn't recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend. It is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around"
72,C Maire (United States) 15th April 2023,3/10,"""Absolutely horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information."

To start, the plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no reason given. The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there. And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. I could not believe they called this business class."
75,L Keane (United Kingdom) 12th April 2023,2/10,"""seats were cramped and uncomfortable""",✅ Trip Verified |  Worst aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable. My food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile. I would not entertain using BA again. Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down. We expected so much more.

Brett Hardy (United Kingdom) 11th April 2023",1/10,"""I enjoyed my flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight. The boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional. The food selection was good and I enjoyed the quality. The was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at T5, so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes. I believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action that week."
77,P Jones (United Kingdom) 10th April 2023,9/10,"""found the food menu rather odd""","✅ Trip Verified | Why do you make it so hard? After a so so lounge experience, the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt. It can’t be training, who would do that, it has to be no fear of anything happening. The “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy. The crew were professional but I personally found the food menu rather odd. Essentially, there was one only main that I could handle and was then told they had ran out. I was a few rows in."
78,Colean Wright (United States) 9th April 2023,5/10,"""cover 50% of my new luggage""","✅ Trip Verified |  After several delays and canceled flights, we finally made it to Copenhagen on American Airlines and British Airways flights. My luggage was destroyed, wheels torn off. I had to buy new luggage in Denmark. I made a claim with British Airways to reimburse me but because I didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage, they would only cover 50% of my new luggage. Advice, have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like I did."
79,Andrew Fitch (United Kingdom) 9th April 2023,1/10,"""the worst flight of my life""","Not Verified |  Literally the worst flight of my life. After booking tickets together with my partner, we were then separated: ‘sorry, the flight is full.’ The flight then took off 45 minutes late - no apology. The trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows, and the response was flippant and rude: ‘whoops. Not sure how that happened. What do you want?’ Genuinely appalling from beginning to end. Might as well fly Easy Jet - at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service, not like BA"
80,Mohammed Laidi (United Kingdom) 21st March 2023,5/10,"""made a complaint, nothing happened""","Not Verified | I was meant to fly in January to Algeria. I paid over £300 for the ticket. Just a few days before I was meant to fly, my wife broke her foot. I had to then rebook it in March and pay another £100. I called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay £360. I made a complaint, and nothing happened."
81,S Walder (Austria) 21st March 2023,1/10,"""Every flight was delayed""","✅ Trip Verified |  We have flown repeatedly with British Airways and the One World alliance over the last few weeks. Every flight was delayed. Now we are back at the airport in Miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight. Finally, our luggage arrived in Puerto Rico with a 3-day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip ... we haven't received any information about our luggage to this day, luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there. The last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they can't do anything.  Wir sind in den letzten Wochen immer wieder mit Britisch Airways und dem One World Zusammenschluss geflogen. Jeder Flug war verspätet. Nun sitzen wir wieder in Miami am Flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive Verspätung sodass wir unseren Anschlussflug verpassen werden. Zuletzt ist auch unser Gepäck mit 3 Tagen Verspätung in Puerto Rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren Rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis heute noch keine Info über unser Gepäck erhalten, zum Glück haben wir selbst am Flughafen nachgesehen und es war da… Beim letzten verpspäteten Flug meinte die Kabinen Crew dass auch sie ihre Anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben Flugzeug sitzen und sie können nichts machen."
82,L Garson (United States) 20th March 2023,1/10,"""how far the quality level has slid""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them. The pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it's just a sip. On the shorter flights the seats couldn't even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on board."
83,J Billot (France) 20th March 2023,3/10,"""worst cabin experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified |  
The worst cabin experience ever: cramped seats, very low cost style and uncomfortable. Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service. Catering is also a shame: 250ml of water + a chocolate bar for a 5 hours service. Will never fly BA again."
84,l Higgs (India) 18th March 2023,2/10,"""Very impressive and efficient""","✅ Trip Verified | First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on. Very impressive and efficient!"
85,D Vale (United States) 18th March 2023,8/10,"""We are done with BA""",✅ Trip Verified |  The latest affront. Stood in first class line for an hour. Finally go up front and the BA agent let 4 supposed VIPS with 12-14 large to-be-checked bags in front of all of us. Arrogant and unapologetic. Add this to a long list of post-Covid disappointments. We are done with BA.
86,Glen Patrizio (United States) 17th March 2023,3/10,"""I was left stranded at the airport""","Not Verified |  Booked a flight return flight between London and Munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in December. The return flight was cancelled and re-booked from 3/17 to 3/12. British Airways only notified me of the first change, but not the second. Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone. At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problems. There are no BA representative at the Munich Airport. The confirmation documentation from British Airways was of no value. I was left stranded at the airport."

I was given no reason for this. I telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information. Staff need customer training, better knowledge of their product, and some manners. BA customer service was virtually non existent. I will never fly with them again."
88,G May (United Kingdom) 16th March 2023,1/10,"""A catalogue of failures""","✅ Trip Verified |  A catalogue of failures. We flew from Belfast to Heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours. We missed our onward Air Canada flight to Calgary as a result. On arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as their British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hours. We are now on our way home only to find our Heathrow to Belfast flight, which had already been cancelled and put back 2 hours, is now delayed by another 2 hours. Avoid British Airways like the plague."
89,A Ahmed (United Kingdom) 15th March 2023,1/10,"""it's by no measure good""","✅ Trip Verified |  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard."
90,Larry Schwartz (United States) 8th March 2023,5/10,"""this airline is horrible""","Not Verified |  We are flying Business class for most of our flight and then Premium economy for the balance. In addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional $225/pp for our seats. Now BA is changing planes, they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas (my wife & I) when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional $$ to be re-seated next to each other.  They moved our seats away from each other and we shouldn't have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together! We haven't even flown yet, this airline is horrible."
91,Helen Thomson (Australia) 6th March 2023,1/10,"""avoid flying British Airways""","✅ Trip Verified |  I am in Australia and on Friday night, went online to book a flight from Heathrow to Malpensa (Milan). I did not realise that when I specifically searched for flights to Malpensa it offered options to other airports in Milan. When I received my itinerary by email, it was to another airport in Milan. The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period. As it was the weekend here I was unable to reach their office until Monday when they advised me there was no refund (other than fees) as I had missed the 24 hour cooling off period. Apparently as the ticket was issued in the UK, I needed to contact them. I have now cancelled the ticket and I will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying British Airways."

I was offered an alternative flight with American Airlines which I had no alternative but to accept as I must travel today. I was flying to LA to see a family member who is end of life. The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy. Tried 3 times BA provide telephone number, total useless, no help, given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email. I have been a BA frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer. I now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade. This is completely unacceptable. What has happened to this company? I have had better treatment from Ryanair."
93,M Kaminsky (United States) 2nd March 2023,2/10,"""Would happily fly them again""","✅ Trip Verified |  Would happily fly them again. I had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge. Onboard service on LHR-IST was no frills, but JFK-LHR was impeccable: good food, lots of movies/cds on the IFE, open bar service the entire flight. Friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drink/snack."
94,L Howard (United Kingdom) 2nd March 2023,10/10,"""one drink service on 10 hour flight""","Not Verified |  Flew premium, only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room. Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered. Few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this. New planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room. Devoid of any personality or joy. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4."
95,Pam Schell (Canada) 28th February 2023,4/10,"""squashed into regular seats""","✅ Trip Verified |  First our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight, understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however it lost us one day's experience in Cairo. We were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats, on both flights. As my husband had spasms, he had to stretch his legs across my lap, and not once did ANY of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling. As the service came to us for food, each choice we made we were told, they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left. I did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints. They responded with a $100 pound voucher for our group."

The A380 still has the rather strange configuration in Club World where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position. The A380 was nearly full, rather poor amenity bag. The welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry. The meal was ok but not great, aside the Champagne no European wines on this flight. Service was friendly but rather slow, no spontaneous refills of drinks offered. Acceptable continental style breakfast. Extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar. It was an acceptable experience, nothing more. After landing 50 minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority."

100,M Wilson (United Kingdom) 31st January 2023,5/10,"""catalogue of errors and inconveniences""","✅ Trip Verified |  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above."
101,Christopher Neep (United Kingdom) 28th January 2023,2/10,"""the food was poor""","✅ Trip Verified | Check in agent at LHR was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew. Seat was comfortable with good leg room. However, the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine. In flight entertainment selections we’re very limited. Far inferior to what BA used to offer. Overall, this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money."
102,Kathleen Lucey (United Kingdom) 28th January 2023,4/10,"""No more BA for me""","✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointing. I book BA so I can fly during the day. My return flight at 6pm on 28/1/23 was cancelled, replaced by a flight at 9pm. It took off 1/2 hour late meaning I arrived at Gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections. I had to pay £70 for a taxi home. Plus the seats are really snug. I’m only 5’7” but my knees were hitting the seat in front. No more BA for me. They are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated. Ryanair has better aircraft and take-off slots."
103,Ian Sinclair (United Kingdom) 24th January 2023,3/10,"""Excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | Excellent service both on the ground and on board - while their first class product might not be leading edge, the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket. The Concorde room at Heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip. Flight was slightly delayed out of Heathrow but arrived on schedule in Johannesburg."

New Club World Suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends, courses served individually with cut glass and china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup. Crew excellent. Good choice of movies. Breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the full English which was offered. Arrival on time. What more could you want? Not quite up to Gulf standards overall, but BA seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard"
106,Marian Benedikovic (United Kingdom) 21st January 2023,9/10,"""flight was one of the worst""","✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price."
107,Thomas Kowalski (United States) 19th January 2023,2/10,"""there is a race to the bottom""","Not Verified | It seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines. I cannot even check in because BA requires the submission of documents for Covid restrictions. However the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken. After clicking ""submit"" the form just hangs forever. No error message is given. I tried three different browsers on three different devices. All have the same hang. Which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat. I tried using the chat bot, but after 30 minutes of clicking ""try again"" I thought I had donated enough time to BA."
108,Reyes Diaz (United Kingdom) 19th January 2023,3/10,"""need to cancel the ticket and rebook""","Not Verified |  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago)."

It is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were, but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares! As for having to pay to reserve a specific seat - an antiquated idea. The cabin staff were fine, food acceptable, check-in OK and Business lounge (breakfast) acceptable. The lack of space in the seating area, small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing. Having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive."

J Meares (United Kingdom) 29th December 2022",4/10,"""Upgrade was worth it""",✅ Trip Verified |  Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10. With the luggage fiasco I can't rate it more than 4/10.

Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengers. Very nice new A350 with smart new club suite. Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage it). Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives. Cheese ice cold and tasteless (why can't the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?). Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall: 3 / 10. Flew Air France business the month before which was way better. So sad what's become of BA."
113,S Marton (United Kingdom) 29th December 2022,3/10,"""minimal communication from their team""","✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience with British Airways. After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team. While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them in future."
114,D Bartul (Canada) 28th December 2022,1/10,"""felt misguided and misinformed""","✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for."

116,Amanda Edgar (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2022,8/10,"""treat your customers like idiots""","✅ Trip Verified |  Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots."
117,Andrew Wilkes (United Kingdom) 20th December 2022,3/10,"""cancelled only 4 hours before take off""","Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Do they not check these things? Any help from BA offered - not really."
118,Nick Walker (United Kingdom) 19th December 2022,1/10,"""have to use other airlines now""","Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we've booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service."
119,E King (United Kingdom) 19th December 2022,1/10,"""my suitcase didn’t arrive with me""","✅ Trip Verified | Turned up 3.5 hours in advance, Terminal 5 at London Heathrow was already carnage, 100s of people trying to check in, only 5 desks manned. Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs."
120,T Darsen (United States) 3rd December 2022,5/10,"""My bag never showed up""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day."

122,S SI (United States) 28th November 2022,9/10,"""Extremely sub-par service""","✅ Trip Verified | Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits. This got exhausted just before she got to me. She just looked at me and walked away. Nothing further was offered."
123,R Vines (United Kingdom) 26th November 2022,2/10,"""the service was excellent""","✅ Trip Verified |  I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights from Heathrow to Lisbon this week were very good. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular shout-out to a flight attendant called Jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. I'm going to have to start spending those Avios."

Connor Heward (Canada) 25th November 2022",7/10,"""I thoroughly enjoyed my flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights."

Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight is 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.
127,Raneem Awad  (United States) 19th November 2022,4/10,"""Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA."

J Meares (United Kingdom) 18th November 2022",1/10,"""lounge was overcrowded and worn out""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA."

Food is horrible."
130,M Nettles (United States) 23rd October 2022,5/10,"""Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered""","✅ Trip Verified | Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"

R Gonzaga (Malaysia) 22nd October 2022",2/10,"""cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified |  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention."
132,Ben Mallinson (United Kingdom) 22nd October 2022,8/10,"""Very rude and unhelpful staff""","✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain."

Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response."

L Pulliam (United States) 17th October 2022",3/10,"""All in all BA was just fine""","Not Verified |  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine."

Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future."

First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports."

I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when.

We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama."

Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
150,E Smyth (United Kingdom) 23rd July 2022,5/10,"""A good flight overall""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flight on A380 SFO to LHR. Smooth check in at San Francisco. Airport quiet and efficient. Dedicated BA lounge, excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. Lounge was very crowded though. Minor departure delay and onto A380 upper deck. I prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter. Old style product but clean and well maintained. Staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals. On time arrival, baggage quite slow. A good flight overall."
151,Frank Houiellebecq (United Kingdom) 22nd July 2022,8/10,"""managed to lose my luggage""","✅ Trip Verified |  For this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a bag of potato chips, and a bottle of water. If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage.  I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again."
152,T Payne (United States) 22nd July 2022,1/10,"""get us on a flight 5 days later""","✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK."
153,Rene Verhoef (Netherlands) 20th July 2022,1/10,"""refund process is non responsive""","Not Verified |  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight."
154,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 18th July 2022,1/10,"""Seat was very uncomfortable""",Not Verified |  Reasonably smooth boarding. Meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. Cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.
155,Michael Little (Australia) 18th July 2022,5/10,"""let down by chaotic check-in and boarding""","✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor."

J Roberts (United Kingdom) 17th July 2022",5/10,"""Crew were attentive and charming""",✅ Trip Verified | Routine typical BA domestic shuttle flight. Nothing special. Departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay. Crew were attentive and charming. Usual clean cut BA product that when it works well is fine.
157,Mark Robinson (United Kingdom) 13th July 2022,7/10,"""become an absolute nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified |  Over 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for Covid the day before. They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare."
158,Matthew Sheedy (Canada) 12th July 2022,1/10,"""wonderful BA representative""",Not Verified |  Flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down. Luggage never made it to Toronto and we filed a lost baggage report. Within 24 hours our luggage arrived in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. Would definitely give BA a 5 star rating and have them again.
159,E Smyth (United Kingdom) 9th July 2022,10/10,"""Overall a good flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight."

I was obligated to check-in my carry-on suitcase due to my group number, according to the girl at the front desk. Then, they could miss my two suitcases, plus the luggage of my boyfriend, who traveled with me. After 3 days, they delivered 2 of our 3 bags, and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists. Now, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase is. Always the promise that the bag will be delivered today, but it never happens! No respect with the customer! First and last time with British Airways for sure! I don't recommend at all!!"
162,James Pang (Hong Kong) 25th June 2022,1/10,"""BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it""","✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim's been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. Further to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. The cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. Thanks again for following this up with us. Please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and I hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. Best regards British Airways Customer Relations"". I don't know what ""non payable commercial reason"" is. I am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company."
163,N Gan (Singapore) 25th June 2022,1/10,"""think twice to take BA in the future""","✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast to London on 20 Jun, 0650. I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025. I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510. At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. For the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another number for “urgent cases”, which ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757. Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines. Onboard the aircraft, when I approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, I was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own.  I would think twice to take BA in the future."
164,Kemal Can (United Kingdom) 24th June 2022,1/10,"""I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option""","Not Verified |  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew"
165,Gustavo Sirna Barbosa (United Kingdom) 23rd June 2022,4/10,"""Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone""","✅ Trip Verified | BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing."
166,Simon Fowler (United Kingdom) 23rd June 2022,1/10,"""food choice and quality was poor""","✅ Trip Verified |  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia."
167,M Edwards (United Kingdom) 22nd June 2022,4/10,"""BA standards continue to slip""","✅ Trip Verified |  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip."
168,David Stewart (United States) 20th June 2022,5/10,"""Right now do not use British Airways""","Not Verified |  Right now do not use British Airways. When booking, person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination, but he was wrong. Flight to London was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh, and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight. Coming back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so I thought good, that is probably my luggage. Once back in Boston luggage did not show up. They said we would get it within 24 hours and we didn't, so far it will be at least 2 days."
169,H Schock (Canada) 19th June 2022,1/10,"""never use this company again""","Not Verified |  I could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing. This was a risk I was well aware about when travelling to Greece for my wedding. However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset. The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone). I will never use this company again nor will anyone that I am close to. This has been completely disheartening. Please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication. I have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before."
170,Manan Ghosh (South Africa) 2nd June 2022,5/10,"""provide a hassle free flight to my son""","Not Verified |  My son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines.. But his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached Toronto in time. We are thankful to British Airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son, especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic. Unfortunately, people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively. The flight was very expensive though as we booked late, after being dumped by Air Canada / Swiss air, after they cancelled their flight at the last moment."
171,F Keele (United Kingdom) 1st June 2022,9/10,"""finally agreed to refund my baggage charge""","✅ Trip Verified |  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake."
172,Ken Howie (South Africa) 30th May 2022,1/10,"""Crew were good but lacked the personal touch""","Not Verified |  Boarding on time, but unfortunately from ORT’s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond BA’s control. Crew were good but lacked the personal touch. Old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. However we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. The cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing. Overall a decent flight."
173,S Tharen (Switzerland) 30th May 2022,8/10,"""do not recommend this airline""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flight delays can happen, but the way BA handles such incidents in just way beyond. Our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. Rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line. A rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counter. Will certainly never fly BA again and do not recommend this airline."
174,Wayne Connolly (United Kingdom) 30th May 2022,1/10,"""I will never use them again""","✅ Trip Verified |  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again."

J Davey (United Kingdom) 27th May 2022",1/10,"""they should be ashamed""","Not Verified |  British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamed. Back in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022. Late last year I also booked Heathrow to Malaga for a family wedding in May. Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund. I have now also asked for my Executive Club account to be closed as I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline. My suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline. Any airline."

The airport security lines were not managed well. The gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). It was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. All the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. Amsterdam is the worst airport I have experienced.
178,R Marton (United States) 19th May 2022,1/10,"""They actually give me a voucher""","✅ Trip Verified |  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. They do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours."
179,Lizzy Keough (United Kingdom) 18th May 2022,1/10,"""battling a long overdue refund""","Not Verified |  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. I suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now."

I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hours.

181,W Gordon (Panama) 28th April 2022,10/10,"""food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff""","✅ Trip Verified | I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit."
182,Leslie Percy (United Kingdom) 27th April 2022,8/10,"""Overall a very pleasant trip""","Not Verified |  We flew from Dubrovnik to Heathrow on the 24th April 2022. Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early. Overall a very pleasant trip. We will be flying again with British Airways"
183,K Marishan (United Kingdom) 24th April 2022,10/10,"""have lost all patience with this airline""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. The poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure."
184,Paul MacInnes (United Kingdom) 23rd April 2022,1/10,"""BA have no intention of resolving this""","✅ Trip Verified | Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers."

There were no announcements made, when approached no time frame was given, they simply didn't know. An aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at Johannesburg. Crew arrived late. The aircraft was filthy. We shall never fly Comair again that includes Kulula or BA absolutely shocking service."
186,Rolf Linden (Sweden) 20th April 2022,1/10,"""was a really bad experience""",Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.

Zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. Second situation happened when we arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. When our luggage arrived at Nice airport the day after and received an email from the AVIA Partner lost and found (British Airways Partner) at 13:14PM informing us that our luggage has now arrived in Nice. After multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that I did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in Monaco, it was vital we received the luggage ASAP, the lady replied “If it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning. This has been an appalling experience."
189,K Fama (Australia) 15th April 2022,1/10,"""such terrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again."

Out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US."

Richard Hodges (United Kingdom) 4th April 2022",1/10,"""old Club Class a huge disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again. We pay a lot for ""premium"" seats."
193,Haydn Robinson (United Kingdom) 4th April 2022,5/10,"""Spent an hour checking in""","Not Verified |  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again."
194,Jeff Michel (Switzerland) 3rd April 2022,1/10,"""Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10""","✅ Trip Verified | First, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."
195,M Keare (Australia) 3rd April 2022,5/10,"""Food and service appalling""","✅ Trip Verified |  Have not flown economy with BA for years, what a shock! Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but not available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or JetStar. My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with them. BA you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship Service you used to be."

Richard Hodges (United Kingdom) 2nd April 2022",2/10,"""stop nickel and diming""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats."
197,Frances Firmin (United Kingdom) 2nd April 2022,9/10,"""you can and need to do better than this""","Not Verified |  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case."
198,Edwin Roelink (United Kingdom) 31st March 2022,4/10,"""the limited food served was bland""","Not Verified |  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again."
199,M Edwards (United Kingdom) 31st March 2022,2/10,"""Complete and utter chaos""","✅ Trip Verified |  Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet again. Surely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. The queue for the First Wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to Malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. As Emerald OneWorld, I wish there was an alternative because BA has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since BEA/BOAC days."

I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. What's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with, and I will never be flying with them again."

John Smith (United Kingdom) 5th March 2022",1/10,"""First time using BA premium and likely my last""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 3rd March 2022",1/10,"""smacks of continued cost-cutting""","✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage."
207,B Malten (United Kingdom) 2nd March 2022,5/10,"""continues to go downhill""","✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways continues to go downhill. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. COVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful."

The in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professional. Detailed announcements from the flight deck as well. Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium Economy product on BA is also very good. Comfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent recline. FR superior to any other airline on other Atlantic routes."
209,E Michaels (United Kingdom) 26th February 2022,9/10,"""scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks""","✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules?"

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 25th January 2022",5/10,"""Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard""","✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight."
211,John Prescott (United Kingdom) 25th January 2022,8/10,"""BA has a lot to do to regain its standing""","✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
212,T Rigby (United Kingdom) 19th January 2022,5/10,"""Utterly appalling company""","Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible."
213,Thomas Scrivens (United Kingdom) 12th January 2022,1/10,"""I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday""",Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!
214,Ken Howie (South Africa) 12th January 2022,3/10,"""return trip was disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew"

Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!"
216,G Thanidhar (United States) 9th January 2022,10/10,"""complete disregard for your passengers""","✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!"
217,C Heale (United Kingdom) 9th January 2022,1/10,"""decline into a sub-par service""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days."
218,S Bartan (United States) 9th January 2022,3/10,"""very basic generic airline""","✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline."
219,M Kalsiman (United Arab Emirates) 7th January 2022,1/10,"""doors cannot close till take off""","✅ Trip Verified |  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards."
220,J Prescott (United Kingdom) 20th December 2021,5/10,"""just used the new Club World""","✅ Trip Verified |  We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times."
221,Paul Vella (United Kingdom) 19th December 2021,6/10,"""waited for my bags for 3 hours""","✅ Trip Verified |  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day."
222,Arthur Moore (United Kingdom) 16th December 2021,1/10,"""certainly make us avoid BA in future""","✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible."
223,C Lazzani (Switzerland) 12th December 2021,2/10,"""I am still waiting for an answer""","✅ Trip Verified |  I claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of August, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons. I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn't get a reply. It has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answer. Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service."
224,Mangesh Kulkarni (United Kingdom) 8th December 2021,3/10,"""BA did nothing to ease the process""","✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may not travel again this year at all."
225,Anastasiia Nikolaeva (United States) 6th December 2021,1/10,"""I don't even get an apology""","✅ Trip Verified |  I have a flight booked for January 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was changed. My second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. What kind of answer is that? I mean I still need to fly to where I am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day I am flying will be more expensive. It is a very big inconvenience for me and I don't even get an apology, just cancel!"
226,L Deane (United Kingdom) 2nd December 2021,1/10,"""whole experience was stressful, costly""","✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."

T Darcell (United States) 29th November 2021",1/10,"""British Airways had rebooked with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated."
228,M Edwards (United Kingdom) 27th November 2021,2/10,"""British Airways happy to encourage the spread of Covid""","✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK."
229,N Marsen (Australia) 25th November 2021,4/10,"""was refused an early check in""",✅ Trip Verified |  I was refused an early check in and was told to come back at 2:30pm for a 5.05pm departure.

230,Hollie Thomas (United Kingdom) 7th November 2021,5/10,"""Their customer service is a shambles""",Not Verified |  Currently dreading my flight with BA considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “Live Chat”. All we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me. We just wanted to be able to make a name change. Absolutely impossible. Their website is unusable. Their customer service is a shambles. They couldn’t change the name. Told me that we should’ve done the booking more carefully. Well you’re going to have these people making mistakes. So maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. Like hello it’s the 21st century. You should have a button saying “Change name”. Anyways not the point. The woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do. Then when I gave up towards the end of the call I just said “thanks for your help I’ll deal with it la-“ got cut off. 50 minutes and got nothing. All I can say is good luck.

J Richards (United Kingdom) 6th November 2021",2/10,"""Good professional crew""",✅ Trip Verified | Another BA shuttle flight and a good one. Fantastic flying weather and I would say a 40% load factor. Good professional crew. Friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries. And getting to the A gates at T5 makes for an easy exit. Still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery.

The lounge was an Aspire lounge and shared, it was basic but ok. Flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. There were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this A321. Service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. It’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it. Staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be. Club Europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. The seats are not so comfortable. Not dreadful but something for BA to think about."

He was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call a Supervisor. The Check in Manager, Goncalo Ribeiro, came to our rescue.  Not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our Day 2 test, uploading it onto our PLF’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in. He was at the Gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service. He was a very professional ambassador for BA!"

The A320 was at T3 at a gate with a jetway, nevertheless 168 passengers (full flight) boarded via steps - this caused an hour waiting at the ""gate"" as well as the baggage taking ages. Also the seat recline on G-GATL (9f) is broken."

S Lane (United Kingdom) 24th October 2021",7/10,"""This time it was good value""","✅ Trip Verified |  Usual BA economy trip, pleasant crew. Complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices. I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraft. Very cramped seating and uncomfortable. The armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one. Aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward. I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me. Other than that BA still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced. This time it was good value."

Drinks were fine and proactively served. On arrival efficient PCR testing where it was needed and fast turnaround. Baggage off quick"
238,Oliver White (United Kingdom) 21st October 2021,8/10,"""Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option""","Not Verified |  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option."

The flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delight. On both inward and outward journeys, I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. I was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabin. My particular thanks must go to Amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to British Airways. I cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, Thank you so so much."
240,J Makin (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2021,5/10,"""our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines""",Not Verified |  I’ve had to book six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. It’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.

The flight down from London I was in business class I asked for the mini bottle of champagne that I always treat myself to the cabin crew member said I can’t give you the bottle only a glass. However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service. Breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 7.50 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach. I have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast.

Asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say..'whaa' and then when I said cup of tea she said yes...asked if wanted milk and sugar. Brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets, no spoon or stirrer. Pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before someone came by, eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea. Seriously BA...what are you doing? Is this how you welcome back people to fly?"

Galleries Lounge chock-a-block first thing on a Wednesday morning and T5 seemed as bustling as pre-pandemic. Boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full. Superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away. Expanded Club Europe stretching back 12 rows - the new norm? Departure on time. Good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch. Post-COVID lunch remains restricted - Do&Co must be horrified by what they're having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish I've ever tasted. Wi-Fi access wasn't free for business class passengers: £4.99 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive. Arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at LCA.

248,G Bartakovics (United States) 9th September 2021,2/10,"""stupidity of this whole situation""","✅ Trip Verified |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation."
249,M Himer (United States) 8th September 2021,1/10,"""lost the connecting flight to Tirana""","✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. We were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. I am very disappointed by this experience."

Given water bottle before take off, no welcome drink. Now COVID rules are being relaxed this needs to change. Menu good and food acceptable. Staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience. Managed to sleep a few hours. For the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly. This may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into Gatwick at that time."

That's before I board the flight to Toronto. While i understand schedule changes, and do my best to stay positive and supportive, i contacted the airline, asking for upgrades to a best seat. I asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport. They denied my ask, no explanations and no empathy. Not only that, but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation. Again, not the change in schedule, not the extra 5 hours layover time. Just the way they chose to treat a customer who didn't do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute."

But mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass, they assigned 11h and 5d. Called several times but they couldn't do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available. When we boarded, the whole plane was empty and still they didn't allow us to seat together."

I Barton (United States) 22nd June 2021",2/10,"""uncomfortable, miserly experience ""","✅ Trip Verified |  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 13th June 2021",4/10,"""Service was a little perfunctory""","Not Verified |  Aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient, although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present. It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 30th May 2021",9/10,"""a thoroughly reassuring, coming out of COVID, experience""","✅ Trip Verified | After sixteen months of being grounded by COVID, it felt almost surreal to be back in T5, heading for what to us was essential summer sun in Greece. T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s bully boy attitude. Ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’. Service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual Do&Co quality. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form. Overall, a thoroughly reassuring, coming out of COVID, experience."

Plane was clean and refreshments were provided. My only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before Chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic, even with the masks? My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant. Value for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were so expensive! To be expected though, I know."

263,Nikol Firdzhanova (United Kingdom) 25th December 2020,10/10,"""I do want to thank BA""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in"
264,S Peale (United Kingdom) 9th December 2020,10/10,"""passengers with masks below nose""","✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to London on 5th December. Flight was ok - seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross.  Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other. Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all. When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose. Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them. Of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks, enforced by the airlines."

We have had three cancellations which BA handled superbly. But this flight went ahead. Check in at LHR was fine, no fast track se unity at T5. Galleries South lounge open, they have an app system, it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly. Followed this with a shower (they are open-limited hours). Flight on time and well presented A321. Staff worked hard, nice drinks run, the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times. Landed on time, priority baggage cane off late. Overall, happy with product and would use again."

They did not have milk for my son's bottle, didn't even give warm water for his formula milk. No kids meals, no snacks. Meal portion size was tiny, 1/4 glass of juice. You literally have to beg them for drinks water etc.. Staff was so rude and treated us like trash. If you compare them with Emirates, I would give Emirates 10/10 and British airways 2/10. It's not at all child friendly. I will never travel with them again."
267,Victoria Huber (United Kingdom) 22nd October 2020,3/10,"""my experience with BA was very positive""","Not Verified |  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received."

I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight. I am at a loss as to what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that I valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund. I will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways."

I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in March. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded. If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I'm very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them."

Their subsequent behaviour, was all their fault! After a mammoth effort to contact them, i was offered a full refund.

The breakfast buffet in the BA lounge in Heathrow T5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees. The aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting, very comfortable spacious seats and large high-resolution IFE screens. I like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available. We both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew. The A350 is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the 747 and 777."

The check-in and security were very efficient and the lounge (not belonging to BA) was clean but had a more limited range of food than I would have expected. Boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional. I am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of BA's new A350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality IFE screen was behind the times. However, it was a night flight so I slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tail-winds."

The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time. Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us."

The BA website was updated on 17 March to state ""We’re working closely with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) to continue flying, where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so."" I then checked the FCO website that was also updated on 17 March and it states: ""The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel to Spain."" So it is clear that BA deem it ""safe"" to fly to Spain despite the FCO statement. I know the airline is suffering, like the rest of UK industry and business, but how can they get away with such deceitful practices. It is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds, and are not complying with the British FCO advisory. Is this actually legal?"
283,M Lavelle (United Kingdom) 17th March 2020,1/10,"""not surprised they are in trouble""","Not Verified | London Gatwick to Funchal. British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madeira when the Foreign Office has advised against anything other than essential travel. My wife and her friend were due to fly to Madeira on 17 March for a week's holiday when we found out that the FO had advised against travelling there. The Madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend 14 days in quarantine no matter how long their stay, that's a week longer than their proposed stay. Her friend contacted BA but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on! They offered a voucher. If this is an example of BAs customer service I am not surprised they are in trouble."

D Gold (United Kingdom) 17th March 2020",1/10,"""narrow business class facing seats""","✅ Trip Verified |  Lower Deck Club Class seat, with the current awful, narrow business class facing seats. British Airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best, and Club Class is simply terrible. My food was not fit for consumption. WIFI broken. Crew morale low. IFE quality a bad joke. To add insult to injury, the  amenity packs are contemptible. What makes BA management think that business people require, (or indeed would retain) a package of socks, mask, plastic pen, and disposable tooth brush? The ongoing decline of this once-great national airline is palpable."

Another grim flight with British Airways in Club Class, on a tired and old B747-400. The Business Class at BA is by far the worst in the industry. The dreaded ying / yang configuration is going to be with us for some time, sadly. In flight entertainment with tiny screen, no HD, and poor movie selection. WIFI did not work, as usual. Food continues to be desperately poor, and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly. This airline needs major overhaul, and investment in new aircraft and seats."

Cancelled my booking for flight refund online, but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards. However, the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information. A 5 year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that BA currently has, and my patience of being loyal to BA (for over 40 years I might add) has run out.

P Burton (United Kingdom) 4th February 2020",9/10,"""a good experience with no major complaints""","✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Sofia. A good experience onboard one of BAs recently refreshed A321 cabins, although unfortunately without any in-seat power supply, contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get in-seat power following refresh. Another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the BA product. However the flight overall was very good. As usual an extremely efficient pre-flight experience at Heathrow's excellent T5. Fast track security was fast, as expected. Galleries Club Lounge was pretty good, and not too crowded. Boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual. The crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service, with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight. The food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering. I found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11"" chap. So overall a good experience with no major complaints."

I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. Iberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money - don't waste your money on this."
300,M Larson (Canada) 22nd January 2020,5/10,"""still consider other airlines""","✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines."

One of the best flights I’ve had in a premium cabin. The service, seat, food and wine are among the best I’ve experienced. The only gripe I had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by BA. The cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch. I would not hesitate flying First class with BA on my next flight."

However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. Being a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in Paris will be spent without luggage."

The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough."

Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later. Conclusion, never fly BA again."

Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’, I.e. a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. The hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges. Comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering.

It's not what it used to be but most importantly, it does not deliver what it promises any longer.  Disappointing food, outdated and uncomfortable seats, appalling baggage handling at LHR, and  mediocre crew service onboard. The customer service online is just as bad. My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together. However, my dealings with customer service was appalling. When is BA going to offer a kids free zone in Club World for people who need to work or sleep?"

They gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together. The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I’ve flown. The check-in process at Heathrow was disastrous. The most inefficient process with no human assistances. The limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers. I would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier. I wish I would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them."

Flight not full, Seated in 7F aisle seat, no one in the middle seat so very pleasant. It is away from the Toilet over at 7A/B but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight. Food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all. I did watch some films but I had already been on a previous BA Long Haul so was not really looking for much. I had some rest as it was a long day and I getting a cold! Arrived late due to a technical problem at Heathrow, they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour I must say I didn't really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate.

I was not recognised as Oneworld elite flyer (hold a Gold Card with Qatar Airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage. I was denied lounge access as QR does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on QR. There is no Oneworld  lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with an entitled Oneworld card different from Qatar Airways. For BA I do not have status. In London granted access to any Oneworld lounge. Onboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not free. Flights were full, but on time. I found that the onboard charity collection by FAs is inappropriate and intrusive. Luggage delivered perfectly. Return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early. Granted lounge access in Billund in the decent King Amlet and BA Galleries First in T3 in London. Loads of good, hot foods and good beers and wines. Onboard there is no IFE, no seat recline.

The seat while old, is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space. The window seats are best for privacy. I am tall and had no issues sleeping. In fact, I slept for almost 7 hours. The service and food out of London was top notch, fresh and plentiful, which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on Qantas. Service was consistent, polite and very attentive.

A cabin crew member, came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and I was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers, which he called earplugs. I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when I fly. I told him I could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job. I wrote in to British Airways with my complaint, but they have not even bothered to respond. Awful, rude airline."

The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product."

327,Cameron Martin (Australia) 8th December 2019,8/10,"""cabin crew where fantastic""","Not Verified | London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. We were on the ground in Singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable. We had exit row seating for entire flight which I recommend to anyone over 6ft tall."
328,D Jonas (United States) 4th December 2019,8/10,"""utter nightmares""","✅ Trip Verified | London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service ""business class""? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. Never again."
329,A Ward (United Kingdom) 4th December 2019,1/10,"""the shortage of staff""","✅ Trip Verified |  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing."
330,D Hinton (United Kingdom) 18th November 2019,5/10,"""Movie selection below average""","✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London. A380 is a wonderful aeroplane. Movie selection was below average. Staff were polite. Fist time I used the call button mid-flight response was fast, but on second occasion I was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutes. I don’t see how that is acceptable."
331,Darren Haynes (Australia) 18th November 2019,5/10,"""What a disappointment of an airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Singapore with British Airways. Packed in like sardines in a tin can. What a disappointment of an airline. They pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration. You awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze. My seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past (very narrow passage ways). Would not and could not recommended this airline. These seats are at best premium economy."
332,D Anderson (United Kingdom) 18th November 2019,1/10,"""I begrudge flying with them""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Mauritius. We are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines. Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline."
333,Carol Lemmens (Netherlands) 17th November 2019,1/10,"""excellent premium host service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Amsterdam via London.

334,J Cohlen (Ireland) 16th November 2019,10/10,"""a remarkably bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul."
335,L Benaud (Australia) 16th November 2019,2/10,"""It used to be a good airline""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a ""mix up"" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a ""mix up"" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. The flight attendants are rude. It used to be a good airline."
336,M Beale (United Kingdom) 13th November 2019,2/10,"""left a great deal to be desired""",✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Lisbon. Mediocre. The flight was very smooth and arrived on time. Cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions. No bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered. Not a great Club Europe experience.
337,D Wheeler (United Kingdom) 13th November 2019,2/10,"""Food was fairly good both ways""",Not Verified | London to Boston. Comfortable flight in economy class. Food was fairly good both ways - dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east. Got some solid sleep in on the flight back.
338,C Irving (United Kingdom) 12th November 2019,9/10,"""a very friendly and welcoming crew""","✅ Trip Verified | Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so."
339,Bradley Burrows (United Kingdom) 11th November 2019,9/10,"""Great service on this flight""",✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia. Great service on this flight. Thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew. Excellent Service.

We tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into Gatwick. The flight was quite good. Service was fantastic, and the chicken tikka masala was tasty. The crew onboard was friendly, flight was on time, and landing was amazingly smooth."

I arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed, I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have to leave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the plane. In London I made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait"
342,J Michel (Switzerland) 29th October 2019,1/10,"""no free food nor drink""","Not Verified |  Zurich to London return. Both legs travelled with hand luggage only, and I could not choose a seat without paying. Fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least. Hand Luggage fares are last to board, make them uncomfortable on board, no free food nor drink."

Efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to First at $760 per person which we declined. Refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks. Boarding on time but could have been better controlled. Flight left and landed ahead of schedule. Flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip. Business Class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints.

Check in was fast and efficient and using the BA Terminal-5 First Class check in and security area was really good and I was straight into the lounge. Great selection of food and drinks early morning. I really like the BA boarding process i.e.by Group numbers. The onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent. Overall very happy with this short flight with BA.

Your service is exemplary."

One toilet closed (nobody around to repair ?). on one point BA even better than asian companies. its even more freezing. why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip ? no staff to answer my question. no staff to make it better. one good point, the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better."
349,C Salander (United Kingdom) 25th October 2019,2/10,"""clueless staff full of attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Malaga. A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. SMS confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. Stiff and no recliner seats. Cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is. Horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price."

351,D Webb (United Kingdom) 12th October 2019,9/10,"""zero feeling of comfort""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew back from Abu Dhabi in World traveller plus. The seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat, seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort, I got no sleep. A snack was served after take off which was quite tasty, but breakfast was just dismal, tasteless. Not much interaction with the crew, but they seemed friendly enough. Would not travel with British Airways in this cabin again, really not worth the price tag."

353,Mirco Roberto Rosa (South Africa) 11th October 2019,9/10,"""cancelled and rescheduled""","✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Amsterdam via London. After many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm. The following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same ""technical"" fault reported 24 hours previously. Finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our ""no show"" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking."
354,P Jacobs (United Kingdom) 9th October 2019,2/10,"""the experience was outstanding""","✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new ""business suite"" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don't know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product."

When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight with BA next year. Thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service."

Entertainment was good. Food was just ok, although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldn't be my first choice to serve. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable. Super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours. For a 9 hour flight this is painful. Paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on. Recommend for short trips."
360,Steve Lyons (United Kingdom) 27th September 2019,5/10,"""I never received the refund""","Not Verified |  I did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28. I never received the refund."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 26th September 2019",1/10,"""not too bad, all in all""","✅ Trip Verified | The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all."

The flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago Time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airport. Finally, at 10 pm we managed to board on the A380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible. The IFE completely unfunctional and with no food served. During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 9:30 pm Zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm. Very stressful at least the staff were nice."

Although I had pre-ordered a vegetarian option, the caterer hadn't provided any (so they said) - but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue. The food was good, and the wine (french, Bourgogne) also surprisingly good. Flight attendant was professional, polite and attentive to detail. All in all, a great flight."
364,M Irving (United Kingdom) 21st September 2019,9/10,"""the value was very good""","✅ Trip Verified | Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault."
365,S Deane (United Kingdom) 19th September 2019,9/10,"""Abysmal customer services""","✅ Trip Verified |  I wouldn't even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via On Business. 1 bag lost in transit. Ground crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off! After an email to their CEO & Director of Brand and Customer Experience received a call from Global Engagement Executive Team offering £100 e-voucher. Abysmal customer services. No wonder their reputation is in tatters. I will never fly BA again."

Boarding was by the now standard groups, which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridge. The flight deck then informed us that we’d be waiting on a stand for 1 hr 20 minutes before our departure slot. Once in the air, cabin crew delivered the usual Club Europe experience, which was mediocre at best. Fortunately, arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of Kefalonia airport 30 minutes later. Overall, a typical BA experience that’s lacklustre at best."
370,S Bailey (United Kingdom) 7th September 2019,5/10,"""standards on BA have plummeted""","Not Verified |  Orlando to Gatwick. Travelling home was extremely disappointing. The aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made. The standards on BA have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame. I hope management are looking at reviews such as this, to improve service."
371,M Leyton (United Arab Emirates) 6th September 2019,2/10,"""Good value flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Abu Dhabi. This is the daytime flight from London. A very good flight. The food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of Etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service). The children’s meals were excellent. The entertainment system was great with a good selection. It makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (Etihad, why don’t you do this?). The cabin crew were good. Economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many. Good value flight, especially as the only other carrier to Abu Dhabi is Etihad."

Michael Papalamprou (United Kingdom) 6th September 2019",8/10,"""not worth the money""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to St Petersburgh. Huge disappointment for BA business class service in European routes. Seat pitch has been reduced to 30"" over the last years (from 34"") at the expense of passenger comfort. Seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat. Food for me was half-empty plates representing a deli experience, and leaving me hungry. Out of the three options offered, two were already out of stock, so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option. Avoid Club Europe, not worth the money."

E Piers (Australia) 4th September 2019",2/10,"""the food was horrendous""","✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. Paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. Reasonable price and speed."
374,J. Knopf (United States) 4th September 2019,4/10,"""buyer beware""","Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware."
375,A Foster (United Kingdom) 1st September 2019,2/10,"""a waste of money""","✅ Trip Verified | I have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of money. The food was no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. This might be a British trait as I’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience."

I am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard. I did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at Heathrow airport. Over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with BA and Heathrow airport. #happyautism# Thank you"

N Trabolini (United Kingdom) 28th August 2019",10/10,"""feel worthless as a customer""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly from London City to Amsterdam on 24/7, Business Class. Once at LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. A state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a busy day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I kept on waiting. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not."

On the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that I would not be able to make it and so I got in touch with British Airways on Twitter advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. I understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro. I have been trying to speak to British Airways on Twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change. British Airways is being dishonest and should be avoided."

On arriving at Gatwick airport and checking in I learn that my interpretation of the USA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. Towards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for me. The return journey went without a hitch and BA's check in at Orlando was quick and easy.

Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling. Now I’m hoping against hope I might make it home today, 3 days after setting off!"

There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying. Book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. What a useless organisation. I must state staff on plane very good."

Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flight. Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker."

K Lee (Thailand) 29th July 2019",1/10,"""flight has improved my opinion on British Airways""","✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again."
398,David Worten (United Kingdom) 28th July 2019,8/10,"""seat comfort has been sacrificed""","✅ Trip Verified |  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity."

Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours.

Initial flight from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was cancelled, had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well. Service with not a free glass of water on the first leg. Abu Dhabi to London delayed by over 3hrs. A generous Dirham 20 voucher (£3,8) received from BA, which was enough for a bottle of water, or a coffee."

E Garman (United States) 17th June 2019",5/10,"""Crew was pretty average""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dusseldorf. No free drinks or food, which is pretty normal for short haul flights. Crew was pretty average Seat was average. Ground crew was pretty nice. No inflight entertainment."
411,L Irving (United Kingdom) 16th June 2019,6/10,"""certainly one of the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Seoul. Nightmare experience with British Airways almost constantly. My Business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours long-hauls flight! Lounge simy sucks, cheap, noisy and croweed. Multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table. Given the price it Charge, certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take."
412,Janet Elphick (United Kingdom) 14th June 2019,1/10,"""more cramped than I expected""","Not Verified |  London to Vancouver. Economy was a lot more cramped than I expected. BA had crammed seats in. Crew were okay. Food reasonable really although I had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame. Flew back premium class, more room. I probably won’t use them in November when I go back. Timing was good and air quality felt ok as I didn’t get a headache."
413,Aman Khanna (United Kingdom) 14th June 2019,7/10,"""ready with another ticket""","❎ Not Verified | Newcastle to Delhi via London. At check-in , I was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. I paid a total of £65 for 2.8 kilos. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding I asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse. Delays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. But as I landed at Delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking."
414,D Smith (United States) 12th June 2019,3/10,"""Not worth the money""","✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Delhi via London.  The BA business class I flew for the first time recently was the worst I have  flown. Whereas most have four seats across British Airways has eight! The lay down beds are hard, thin and short. Not worth the money."
415,Bronte Williams (Australia) 9th June 2019,1/10,"""So much for British Airways""","Not Verified |  London to Sydney via Singapore. Checked in with a bag which was 23.4kg. My allowance was 23kg. I was made to repackage the bag and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage, really? I found the food on both legs of the flight horrible."
416,James Leonard (United States) 9th June 2019,3/10,"""cramped seat with no lights""","✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Amsterdam via London. It was 10 hrs on a delayed flight, in a cramped seat with no lights, no call light. No entertainment of any sort, and food I found exceptionally bad. The B747 that was terribly maintained. The offer of 20.GBP for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety."
417,G Leane (United States) 8th June 2019,4/10,"""special meal not on either flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Standard, run of the mill airline for today's economy. Flew Tel Aviv to New York, with a two hour layover in London Heathrow. Crew was fine, entertainment system on the London to New York leg was very nice. The special meal I ordered was not on either of the two flights. I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were. I submitted a complaint to ba.com and the responses I received were lame and unacceptable. Not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from British Airways, as I suggested topping off my Avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500)."

T Reid (United States) 7th June 2019",3/10,"""I might fly them again""","✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5."
419,Carol Marchand (Spain) 7th June 2019,5/10,"""the crew that was so nice""","✅ Trip Verified |  Buenos Aires to London. I wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while I was terribly sick. Wish I knew their names! They gave me medicine, a blanket and caressed my back while I was crying from the stomach ache. Forever grateful."
420,Mark Simons (United Kingdom) 28th May 2019,5/10,"""couple of very good flights""",✅ Trip Verified |  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.
421,Ken Howie (South Africa) 28th May 2019,9/10,"""service on this flight was superb""","✅ Trip Verified |  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through."

Dan Winkowski (United States) 27th May 2019",10/10,"""Very nice experience""","✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. In flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with I like over the monitors. AA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 27th May 2019",9/10,"""an old style business class experience""","✅ Trip Verified | CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience."
424,C Perton (United Kingdom) 27th May 2019,7/10,"""The legroom was terrible""","✅ Trip Verified |  Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again."
425,Michael Hunt (United Kingdom) 26th May 2019,1/10,"""seat was uncomfortable""","✅ Trip Verified |  Lima to Gatwick. Helpful and courteous cabin crew.  The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory. The screen was small and in poor condition. Movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor. The touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally, without warning, increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset. A 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system."
426,Alison Wescott (United Kingdom) 23rd May 2019,5/10,"""comfort was very bad""","✅ Trip Verified | Inverness to Auckland via Singapore with British Airways. Service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flight. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights."
427,C Lewis (Australia) 23rd May 2019,3/10,"""expected a better level of attention to detail""","✅ Trip Verified | I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight."
428,Michael van Eimeren (United Kingdom) 23rd May 2019,4/10,"""an hour or so to drop off luggage""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was OK, minor delay didn't both me. What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time? They continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight."
429,Ian Robinson (United Kingdom) 22nd May 2019,3/10,"""return flight extremely poor""","✅ Trip Verified |  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor."

Christopher Neep (United Kingdom) 8th May 2019",5/10,"""BA were way ahead of the competition""","✅ Trip Verified | Vancouver to London. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competition.

431,DAVID MEAD (United Kingdom) 8th May 2019,9/10,"""four rows away from my partner""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. All so wrong. Lounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid, left most of it. Paid for and travelling Business Class and allocated four rows away from my partner,  this is normal procedure. Apparently on top of a £2000 six night holiday I should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner - total madness. This is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked Norwegian for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos Aires, did not even bother to look at BA."
432,Philip Gregory (United Kingdom) 7th May 2019,1/10,"""nothing too much trouble""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training."
433,Tony Hall (United Kingdom) 7th May 2019,8/10,"""pleasant and professional""","✅ Trip Verified | Rome Fiumicino to London City. A BA Cityflyer service. No wait to check in. Aircraft was not full. We pushed back early and arrived early. This route still has complimentary refreshments in economy, including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise. Cabin service was pleasant and professional. A really excellent flight."
434,P Merton (United Kingdom) 4th May 2019,10/10,"""disappointing business class""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough."
435,Tamara Vileta (United States) 4th May 2019,2/10,"""customer service is horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Their customer service is horrible. Lost our bags. Here we sit in London after 2.5 days of wearing the same clothing. We fly out in 3 hours to Barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go. I spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. It was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime. We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking. Not one single person at British Airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matter. One customer service agent even asked me if we would be OK getting out to Heathrow to ""pick them up."" Truly the worst customer experience I've had."
436,M Christie (United Kingdom) 2nd May 2019,1/10,"""Thanks to the crew""","✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. Around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne, Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. Thanks to the crew."
437,Bianca Schuster (Romania) 1st May 2019,9/10,"""delayed for 5 hours""","✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). We lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund. Returning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it.

440,Alwaleed Althani (Qatar) 14th April 2019,5/10,"""behind the competition""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Doha. Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. The food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage."
441,B Meares (United Kingdom) 14th April 2019,6/10,"""staff exceptionally friendly""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Houston. Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful."
442,Roger Street (United Kingdom) 14th April 2019,9/10,"""personal space is so tight""",Not Verified |  Larnaca to London. This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. The seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. Having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing.
443,C Stainer (United Kingdom) 14th April 2019,2/10,"""arrived reasonably promptly""","✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly."
444,C Stainer (United Kingdom) 13th April 2019,5/10,"""very professional and pleasant""",✅ Trip Verified |  The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.

446,G Mearson (United Kingdom) 11th April 2019,10/10,"""onboard service was abysmal""","✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to London Gatwick. Paid for a Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal. No refreshments offered on boarding. Dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?"
447,H Warner (United Kingdom) 11th April 2019,3/10,"""both involuntarily downgraded""","✅ Trip Verified |  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you."
448,H Bayley (United Kingdom) 10th April 2019,1/10,"""had to have a middle seat""","✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London. Cancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight. Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this."

I flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude. I was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter. I found the food portions so meagre. Not sufficient for a child also.  British Airways is sad in every sense of the term.
450,C Dean (United Kingdom) 18th March 2019,5/10,"""Effectively a budget airline""","✅ Trip Verified |  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory."
451,David Taylor (United Kingdom) 16th March 2019,2/10,"""such a poor product""","✅ Trip Verified | Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me."
452,Anthony Groom (United Kingdom) 14th March 2019,1/10,"""a good product and service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service."

By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. I ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines."

This airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members. The lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments. The bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available. I'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend British Airways. Keep it up guys."
459,S Beale (United Kingdom) 9th March 2019,10/10,"""effectively a low cost airline""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business."

We left on time, and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.  Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained."

Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand."

I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work."

From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline."

Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. You will get an email a month later saying ""I'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund"". Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service."

When I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. I finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days, it was impossible to get someone on the phone. On my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats available.

After take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal. Portions of starter very small, I was given someone else’s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him. I thought that originally the idea of the new Club World meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that. Main was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selection. Then bed, gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable. Breakfast was ok. Delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue (there seemed to be a few of these). Arrivals lounge was good.

I asked for tissues and the answer was, get it from the toilet. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration. And then - while boarding at Edinburgh, they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight. 4 hours gap mind you."

I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double.

Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. This was really poor service. Especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us.

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 30th January 2019",2/10,"""reasonable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand. Overall, a reasonable flight but not first class."

The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. Cabin crew were generally good and the CSM was particularly visible during the flight. Breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. Arrival was ahead of schedule."

A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea.

At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg.

Pawornprach Pakdeeteva (Thailand) 30th December 2018",5/10,"""the cabin was modern and clean""","✅ Trip Verified | I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better."

Peter Driscoll (United Kingdom) 29th December 2018",8/10,"""most uncomfortable plane""","Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior."
492,Mike Mangum (United States) 24th December 2018,7/10,"""could not upgrade the flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a flight through Expedia for June 21019 from Denver to Paris via London on the promise that I could upgrade using Avios. After booking the flight and trying to upgrade, was notified that I could not upgrade the flight due to how I purchased the ticket, paid about $250 for early seat selection on both flights, after buy up to the front of the plane, was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation, - but found out they gave the seats, that I paid extra for, to another party. Could request a refund, but wouldn't honor what they had sold me in the first place. They would not honor a refund either. Then I became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of $3380 plus paid for upgrades."

B Stauffer (South Africa) 24th December 2018",1/10,"""a total disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast. That flight was a total disappointment."
494,H Jones (United Kingdom) 24th December 2018,1/10,"""last time flying with BA""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Kuala Lumpur. This is my first time flying with BA to Kuala Lumpur on the Dreamliner 787. Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. This will be my last time flying with BA unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the A380. I am dreading on my next return flight back to London. Crews were friendly and helpful. No fault with that."
495,Muthu Ramar (United States) 23rd December 2018,1/10,"""I don’t like pasta""",✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Very poor customer service. I checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can I have aisle seat and she just said no. I asked her why and she replied that they don’t have any. In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat. They served dinner and said we don’t have any more chicken so you can have pasta. I told him I don’t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food. He said the pasta is vegetarian.
496,A Mezati (United States) 23rd December 2018,4/10,"""not going to receive refund""",✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight from Seattle to London in November 6th was canceled due to technical problems. After waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the BA associate couldn’t find us any immediate flight. They offered us a flight that would arrive in London late November 8th. It would take us 16 hours. Since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in November 8. I would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. My trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival I had to return in less than two days. They advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking. I filed a claim online based on their instruction.  The customer relation phone number is disconnected. In fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call”! The website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist. After 1.5 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them.
497,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2018,1/10,"""so much BA could do to improve""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women."
498,Alex Johnson (United Kingdom) 19th December 2018,6/10,"""Fantastic first class service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Moscow to London. Fantastic first class service. The Moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent Runway views. Quick boarding, and I was escorted to my seat by the crew. The new First seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. There's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. The 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. The dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal I've had. Drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. The crew were very attentive and friendly with it. A fantastic experience, and I'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin."

For supper I asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as I don't drink tea or coffee for health reasons. Given with no problems. For breakfast I requested the same and I was refused. I explained I don't drink tea or coffee but milk and water."" We don't keep hot water, I can get it once we have finished serving all other customers"". That never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger. I kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water, explaining I have been waiting. He said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. I felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing."

501,M Lewis (United Kingdom) 9th December 2018,10/10,"""transformation into an overpriced EasyJet""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. During this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. This airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements BA's transformation into an overpriced EasyJet. Will not fly with them again."
502,L Carini (United States) 7th December 2018,2/10,British Airways customer review,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have been loyal customers with British Airways since I was a little girl. Every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in Italy. On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. In addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience I’ve ever encountered.  I am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor I will fly with them in the future."

James Byrne (United Kingdom) 5th December 2018",1/10,"""a very enjoyable flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Las Vegas. Boarding by group number seemed to work well at Gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. The crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I’ve ever had on a long haul flight. The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to HD quality these days. All in all a very enjoyable flight."
504,P Downing (United Kingdom) 3rd December 2018,7/10,"""Premium Economy is a joke""","Not Verified |  Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it. Other airlines do this better."

The bag drop process took an hour even though I had checked in already. The staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. Another flight attendant didn’t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. Not exactly best of British, and I’ll certainly not be recommending!"

Joerg Boese (Germany) 28th November 2018",3/10,"""miserable customer service""","✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight. This is miserable customer service."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 27th November 2018",1/10,"""an excellent flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel."

During check-in using the BA app, there was a problem that I had to re-start, after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold. After calling BA and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay £65 at the airport desk. What a rip off for a short flight. By curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money BA asked for the bag."
511,U Davis (Australia) 5th November 2018,1/10,"""would not recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | I would not recommend this airline. I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't do anything to help change this. We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. Don't bother flying BA."

However I did have seat 2J so it was right up front. I am not sure where to begin. Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations."

My long haul flight was also good, aircraft was 20yrs old but clean, cabin crew were very nice, friendly and efficient, my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic, the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff, and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of, apart from that, absolutely great, well recommended."

The check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. Boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tedious. Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA. Well done to the superb crew!"

Miguel Galeno (United States) 25th October 2018",9/10,"""I was disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option. They need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers."

E Gardner (United Kingdom) 15th October 2018",5/10,"""BA club world is a farce""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic. Never again, BA club world offered is a farce in today's business market."
521,Gordon Smith (United Kingdom) 13th October 2018,2/10,"""BA lacks consistency""","✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills. I now have 91000 Avios going to waste as my business will be going else where."

523,Bruce Symons (Canada) 6th October 2018,1/10,"""5 mins too late for me to check in""","Not Verified |  Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways. Like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support."
524,B Maltin (United Kingdom) 1st October 2018,1/10,"""aircraft interior was old""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice."

When I checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me €70 as compare to €35 online price. Afterwards I phoned customer care to discuss the issue, customer care agent has dropped my call three times. On fourth time I was talking one of the customer care agent. He was not helpful at all, then I asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager, they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said manager is busy. This is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy. British Airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage. British Airways was always my first priority. Unfortunately, I won’t be flying again with British Airways due to this awkward behavior."

This, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just. Outbound we went through the ""First"" wing check in at T5. (We are Gold card members). The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. The South lounge was rammed. We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather nice. The Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. A very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. Coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm Ali. We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. The seating is still hopeless. Three seats between two and zero legroom. BA really should look at the competition in the Far East who offer excellent regionalized business class. The product is only worth it in a Sale or Avious points. The every day fare price is ludicrous."
529,Helen Vozenilek (United States) 24th September 2018,6/10,"""never fly British Airways again""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? I will never fly British Airways again."

Richard Callis (Brazil) 10th September 2018",5/10,"""staff were very efficient""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Madrid to London Heathrow. The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact, I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon. I love flying in 767s, the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve this. Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BA's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere. The flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience. Food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks. I'll be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 10th September 2018",8/10,"""experience is second rate""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Brindisi. We weren’t expecting the long queue for Club Europe check-in, but mid-afternoon is apparently particularly busy in T5. Galleries South lounge was also teeming, but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food. Group boarding was handled efficiently. The A321 was relatively new and clean, no pre-take-off drinks were offered. Departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time. The Club Europe section was unusually busy, with at least ten, fully occupied rows, including families with pre-school children. Despite the congestion and chaos, the food and drink service was handled efficiently, although the food was no better than the old World Traveller offering. It’s hard to see the point of BA’s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate."

Robert Watson (United Kingdom) 8th September 2018",4/10,"""British Airways is a rip off""","✅ Trip Verified | I have BA silver membership. This promises fast track, choice of seats at booking, priority boarding and lounge access. I would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst. The majority of the time my seat choice is changed, fast track at Heathrow is slower than the normal queue, and the lounges so overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat. The Iberia lounge at Madrid is equality poor, with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast. British Airways is a rip off. I have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their A321 and seat 22c. This seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others. Yet on BA.com they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom. I recently travelled on Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal BA/Iberia are by comparison."

Check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it. All in all an unsatisfactory airline."

TV screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment. Plane was looking it's age and a bit run down around the edges. Premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380. What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Polite, efficient, welcoming and nothing was any bother for her. Service with a smile from start to finish . People in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job. Also meals and drink selection very good. Although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done BA and looking forward to return journey."

Business Class seating in 787/9 very conducive for family travelling, allows for interaction. Forward Business Class cabin on 787 is fairly private. Service on both flights was flawless, very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals. Food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic. Outstanding crew on BA 603 and BA 99 - on our outgoing flights from Toronto on August 16 similar great service. BA gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience. Their seating arrangement in Club World is perfect when travelling with family. Other carriers may have an advantage if one travels alone."

540,Mike Palmer (Canada) 15th August 2018,5/10,"""improved on board experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to LHR and LGW to Toronto return in WT+. Finally, BA has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. All that said, I felt that BA is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. Long may this improvement last!"

Richard Hodges (United Kingdom) 15th August 2018",8/10,"""Really very good FA's""","✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London Heathrow on the lower deck of the A380 - a very quiet smooth flight. Did not want to pay the usual BA extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. Of course the usual BA Club Class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World. Welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FA. OK meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. Much more up to date touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA's - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. As usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat. If Virgin Atlantic fly the same route I will always choose their Upper Class as everyone has aisle access and you don't have to pay to pre-reserve your seat."
542,C Barton (United Kingdom) 14th August 2018,7/10,"""this time they were superb""",✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dublin. This was an early morning departure from Heathrow on a full flight. BA managed everything in a very professional manner. The bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules. The cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video. During this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression. I had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb.

L Shearen (United Kingdom) 12th August 2018",7/10,""" a very acceptable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects."
546,K Lorney (United Kingdom) 11th August 2018,7/10,"""pathetic compensation""","✅ Trip Verified |  Amman to London. Appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers."

R Neale (United Kingdom) 9th August 2018",1/10,"""let down by the ground services""","✅ Trip Verified |  Paphos to London Gatwick in Club Europe. We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UK. We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show. BA has some great assets, particularly the cabin crew, but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight Like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case BA were lacking."

We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glass.

New York to Nairobi via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. The IFE on the LHR-NBO leg reminds me of the game ""pong"" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. BA charges to select Business Class seats. For my family of 4, it would have cost over $1,600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 segments."
550,S Teen (Netherlands) 23rd July 2018,5/10,"""A delayed BA flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Amsterdam. A delayed BA flight by 55 mins. Old airplane, unhelpful staff. Delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays. Another terrible show from British Airways."
551,P Kim (South Korea) 23rd July 2018,3/10,"""On arrival no bags""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Barcelona . Check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff. Staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight. However, the in flight product has deteriorated - salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers - had to have sandwich. Seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class. No priority boarding for business passengers. Really disorganized at boarding - calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed up. On arrival no bags and trying to get update but no update. Trying to get update on baggage after 12 hours but no update."
552,Roger Stone (Australia) 23rd July 2018,1/10,"""an enjoyable experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  I thought it time BA deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days. I was fortunate to travel Hong Kong to London return in Premium Economy recently. Being able to check-in at the downtown Hong Kong Airport Express station is a real bonus as is using the good Qantas Lounge at Hong Kong. I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. The new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates. Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. I also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'Goswami' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at Heathrow. All-in -all made for an enjoyable experience, a rarity these days."

C Down (United Kingdom) 22nd July 2018",8/10,"""food and drink was pretty good""","✅ Trip Verified |  Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it. Priority disembarkation and baggage at Gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly."

C Down (United Kingdom) 22nd July 2018",7/10,"""a decent enough flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Faro. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better."
555,Mohammed Aljefri (United States) 22nd July 2018,7/10,"""crew were helpful and generous""","✅ Trip Verified |  Jeddah to Chicago via London. The flight from Jeddah to Heathrow wasn't as good as I expected, ground staff at Jeddah some of them were rude. Also, the new baggage restriction for the flights to the UK made the trip uncomfortable, I had to check my carry-on bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the Power bank were there, they took my laptop when I dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers. However, The crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too. The flight from LHR to Chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous.  I won't fly with BA again until they change their baggage restrictions for the Saudi flights."

I need to fly BA for Business frequently, as I don't have other choices. Not only planes are delayed (as today), but the lounges in Heathrow are a joke. I don't use them anymore as they are overcrowded, and they don't serve proper food, just snacks. Their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests. Their business class in Europe is economy class with a free seat next to you."

When booking the tickets, I realised that by choosing certain flights in Club the fare was cheaper than economy once I had added suitcases and pay for food onboard, I hadn´t flown BA Club in Europe for a while and was looking forward to it. I was nicely impressed. My outbound flight was a wet-lease by Titan but this was the full BA service. The crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet. I was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks. The only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly."

Mark Ellwood (United Kingdom) 19th July 2018",9/10,"""pole vault over passenger's legs""",✅ Trip Verified |  Bermuda to Gatwick. Usual window and Aisle seat taken. Crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese (including sandwiches) not good when someone cannot eat cheese. Breakfast usual offering OK but not really worth the money paid. Seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for BA to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger's legs to get out from the window seat in the night.
559,Mike O'Donovan (United Kingdom) 19th July 2018,7/10,"""seats weren't wide enough""","✅ Trip Verified |  Aberdeen to Boston via London Heathrow. I found the seats weren't wide enough and leg room was restricted. On the way back to London the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room I had to move. Also the narrower seats meant that I really had to avoid taking up both arm rests. Otherwise they were good flights with, slightly odd choices, but decent food. Extensive entertainment options/variety as well."
560,K Farmer (United Kingdom) 10th July 2018,5/10,"""had upgraded people in first""","✅ Trip Verified |  I recently took a first class flight from London Heathrow to Las Vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded. The plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes late. When we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around. The service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated. The return flight was a disaster. The seats were dirty, food was like rubber, plane was dated, seats smelt, Lauren Perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason, some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great. When I complained I was offered 8,000 Avios, are you serious BA? I think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that I experienced on British Airways. Unless a first class ticket on British Airways is on sale, I would suggest you fly with another airline. British Airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty - it’s about time they  had a deep clean and re-model the first class it’s getting so old, it’s like club class with a few tweaks."
561,H Reyes (Ireland) 9th July 2018,5/10,"""first and last experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Had four flights in total with this airline, first flight from Dublin to London on 29th June 2018 was delayed by 2 hours. This delay would have meant we missed our connection in Heathrow to Miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs (no reason or apologies). We arrived in Miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning. By the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab. Our flights home to Dublin via Heathrow were fine until we reached Dublin and realised they had lost our bag. Despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day (it was put on the wrong plane - again no apologies given for this inconvenience). We are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out. Seems like no one cares. This was our first and last experience of using BA."

I recently flew back from South Africa with some sports equipment. Their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance, but I was charged £65 to bring my bike back. The check in staff were very forceful and abrupt. As I had to bring the bike back, I had no choice but to pay. When I got back I contacted their customer service, they are not willing to help.  Also, the seats are getting really uncomfortable. The food is terrible."
563,L Wang (United Kingdom) 8th July 2018,1/10,"""queue for bag drop was massive""","✅ Trip Verified |  The queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 mins. A more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the bag drop. Excuses as I saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine. They could have just got more staff there to begin with. Group boarding was super slow. Inside the econ cabin, the plane seemed very old, and worn-out. The entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn't inform the customers about it. Some of the flight attendants were unprofessional. Meals were bad for me, the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good. They gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight. The wifi doesn't exist in the cabin."
564,David Moss (United Kingdom) 5th July 2018,1/10,"""they did not care""",✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class. No co-ordination at airport and apparently not one BA manager at Rome airport who I could speak to. Had to call BA customer service in UK which was a waste of time. Given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position. Failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow. Advised stewardess but they did not care. Could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat. Waste of time paying to go business class with BA.  They did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way.
565,Kirsten Durward (United Kingdom) 29th June 2018,1/10,"""always had a great experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Edinburgh via London. I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew BA for this trip."
566,C Veare (India) 28th June 2018,8/10,"""Disappointing experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to London Heathrow. Disappointing experience. I wouldn't book business class again, felt like bad value for money. I've flown economy and premium economy before, found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. I had one person ask if I needed anything who then brought me the tea I requested. The staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money. I paid an extra £500+ for better food on a tray with cutlery. Really not worth it!"
567,Ian Graham (Netherlands) 27th June 2018,6/10,"""satisfied with all aspects""","✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. It is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlines. As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off. Those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic, but the crew handled the situation admirably. They more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking."
568,W James (United Kingdom) 25th June 2018,7/10,"""seat was below my expectation""","✅ Trip Verified | When you travel British Airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with British Airways staff. Right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight. She spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late. Because I need special assistance they didn't have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it. My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines. The food was just OK nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice. In my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who don't have snobs working for them."
569,S Verden (United Kingdom) 25th June 2018,4/10,"""return flight was faultless""","✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to Gibraltar was faultless. On time (early arrival in fact), smiling friendly crew, excellent hot meal and plentiful drinks. Gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats ok. Gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge."
570,G Leane (Ireland) 19th June 2018,5/10,"""an additional €476 for seat selection""","✅ Trip Verified |  Earlier this year, my wife and I travelled business class with BA from Dublin to Jo'burg, returning from Cape Town, thru London in each direction. Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA. Having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly, we have discovered how much behind the play BA actually are."

Marsha Sheldon (United States) 13th June 2018",1/10,"""no one to solve problems""","Not Verified |  Los Angeles to London. I booked with AA, LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle. They have an endless loop of calling, waiting on line, their agent's can't or won't do anything but sell seats. I spoke to many many supervisors, no results. There is no one to solve problems. They pass the buck, have you fill out forms online and no one responds."
572,Josh Vine (United Kingdom) 13th June 2018,1/10,"""everything was comfy enough""","Not Verified |  The overall flight wasn't too bad. Seats and everything was comfy enough, although my girlfriends television didn't work for either the outbound or inbound flight, and little effort was made for a resolution. I understand that it isn't the flight attendants fault,  but it would have been nice if a little more effort than 'there's nothing we can do' was given to the issue! On the flight from Gatwick to Tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 30-40 minutes as the bridge 'wasn't where it should be' which once again wasn't the worst problem In the world but after a long flight isn't particularly what you wanted! It wasn't the best experience."

David Ellis (United Kingdom) 12th June 2018",3/10,"""FAs went through the motions""","✅ Trip Verified | 
BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule. Overall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product. British Airways are falling ever behind their competitors."

575,Mike Palmer (Canada) 9th June 2018,2/10,"""there was little to dislike""","✅ Trip Verified | I took the new option of the new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and I even liked Gatwick!!"

I was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly Flight Attendants. They walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kinds. I will definitely fly British overseas again given a chance. The economy seats on this old but well kept Boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and I am a 5'9"" x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped. I would encourage all my friends to fly British if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the US to Europe. Thank You British Airways, very good service indeed."

Terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism, they offered £25 voucher and no apology - an insult as did not ask for compensation. It's an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline. On a positive point the Geneva to London flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to Vancouver were abysmal."
578,D Kemble (United Kingdom) 7th June 2018,3/10,"""very pleasantly surprised""",✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have flown BA's Club Europe flying from London Heathrow to Corfu. I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again. I paid around 6500 avios and an extra £13 in taxes which I think was very good value for what I had.
579,Leslie Mardell (United Kingdom) 6th June 2018,8/10,"""budget airlines can do better""","✅ Trip Verified |  Our original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. I consider this to be completely unacceptable. If this is the level of service we can now expect from British Airways, there is no point traveling with them. The budget airlines can do better at lower cost."

C Hearn (United Kingdom) 30th May 2018",5/10,"""they understand my frustration""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Mahon. Booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant in lap (almost £1k for all of us. Pre-booked seats at the same time. I was rather surprised when I got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to Madrid on the 26th May” when I was flying direct Heathrow to Menorca. Airline assured me everything was fine. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). An urgent call to BA I was told 1) I was probably being moved to a bassinet position. When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which I now understand is also incorrect. My concern was well placed. At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). Raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. Separate complaint raised to CAA about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat. Conclusion is families avoid at all costs."

N Collins (United Kingdom) 30th May 2018",2/10,"""a lovely flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to London Heathrow. Lovely flight and a great BA Worldwide Crew, which are the best in the BA fleet. Very good seat with great extras that you would expect in 1st Class. Chose to sleep as it was a night flight, but had a delicious full breakfast in the morning. Baggage allowance was superb with 3 x 32Kg cases and 2 cabin bags. Overall, a lovely flight, with a great airline, that has a great crew"

Kah Kay Au (Singapore) 30th May 2018",10/10,"""a la carte dining option""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Singapore on 28 May 2018. In this review, I am reviewing the a la carte dining option on board for World Traveller. World Traveller passengers have the option to pre-order from a selection of 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights out of LHR with prices ranging from £15 to £18. I had the Gourmet Dining consisting of braised Hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and delicious. If you do not want to risk not getting your meal of choice on a long haul BA flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route, I highly recommend you to go for it."
583,Emily Serchen (United States) 29th May 2018,9/10,"""did not keep us updated""","✅ Trip Verified |  Paris to Newark, flight cancelled. This experience was one of the worst I’ve had. The engineers had no idea what was wrong with the engine, all air and water shut off for three hours. Not to mention the Boeing 757 looked ancient, for a 6 hour flight from Paris I expected a little more. The flight attendants did not keep us updated. Lastly after we got off the plane they had one  receptionist at the desk to deal with the 60+ people who needed to rebook flights and get hotels for the night. Will never fly British airways again. Delta forever."
584,Nicholas Robinson (United Kingdom) 28th May 2018,1/10,"""never fly with them again""","✅ Trip Verified |  I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around £150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane. She apologised and said she'd take our case up with BA customer service. I also sent in a complaint. Today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded. I'll never fly with them again."

S Weare (United Kingdom) 27th May 2018",1/10,"""this experience was a disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified |  Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade. BA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again."

Neil Jeram (Australia) 26th May 2018",2/10,"""IFE is a work of mystery""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely."

Neil Jeram (Australia) 25th May 2018",4/10,"""years have not been kind""","✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002. The years have not been kind to BA. Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlines. Nearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the A380 but that is well known. Very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking. Check in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. No menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC offers a better grade of plastic. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and Coke. This is available on Qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. Final word about this leg is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. One or two interesting things and some new releases. Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not all into Brit Pop and edgy music presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that BA set many years ago."

This review is about the arrangement for check in rather than actual flight. BA allows you to check in online, but not to print out a boarding card. There was no machine to print a card, queue taking 75 minutes to get boarding card, and several people were too late for check in. There were 4 desks 2 for priority, 2 for general check in for all flights. Only 1 desk served, once they were about to close check in"

BA are a disgrace, it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high. My flight from Islay was delayed by 2 hours, no fault of mine, so I missed my connecting flight! After being fobbed off as not my fault, nothing we can do I ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again, I had to pay for another flight. Money grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling"

Having a window seat on the top deck your kind of rest assured you will have privacy and rest. This was successful on the flight with 6 hours slept which was super comfortable which I was surprised at. The meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for BA. The poorest part of the trip is the TV being so small and picture so poor. In the end, couldn't really use it as it was so frustrating amongst other operational issues i.e. press pause and film would start from beginning. Would I fly again, sure why not."
592,S Hosen (United Kingdom) 10th May 2018,7/10,"""full price to rebook""","✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to Heathrow. Very disappointed in British Airways. Having been delayed by a ""partner airline"" and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve, BA charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning. Their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my BA exec club membership so I'd had to book it as two flights. Neither BA or Loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night. Clearly, being a member of the BA exec club counts for nothing. Very bad customer service BA. Seems BA and Loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers."

I lost my jacket on the Shanghai to London flight and ground staff at Heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects."
594,T Razim (United Kingdom) 8th May 2018,9/10,"""I was pleasantly surprised""","✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London Heathrow. I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungry. However my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both ways. On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey. For dinner there was butter chicken, rice and lentils, and a rice pudding type desert, all of which was okay - nothing special."
595,Nicolas Simonis (Greece) 7th May 2018,8/10,"""once again disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified |  Athens to Philadelphia via London. I chose BA because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ATH to LHR they do not serve food and beverages free. On the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats, there was no waste envelope, whilst my inflight magazine was so overused. LHR to PHL an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way, rather poor lunch. I was disappointed with BA especially with their decision to charge for F&B on European flights."

John Rolfe (United Kingdom) 3rd May 2018",5/10,"""Club World cabin very cramped""","✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London Heathrow on B777 in Club World. This was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to HK on an A350 on Cathay Pacific and the difference was huge. The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with Cathay. The seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough. Drinks selection was very good. Plus points go to the cabin crew, who were very professional and had a sense of humour. Understand BA plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough."
597,B Stuart (United States) 3rd May 2018,5/10,"""experience was totally acceptable""","✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow return.  Outbound First Class, return Club World. A380 both sectors, awesome aircraft. Firstly, BA flight deck crews are awesome. Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. Their service was excellent. I wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn’t eat anything, so I can’t comment on the food. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I was in 53K which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their 777-300s. BA business class is really dated, and I said it felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. I was pulled aside for screening 3 times. I don’t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive. I am enrolled in and pay for TSA Pre Check and if British Airways would participate in this program, it would save a lot of angst. Other than that, the overall BA experience was totally acceptable."

Everything is for purchase, I felt cheated. Heathrow Terminal 5 was a big mass. Getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over 1hr within the same terminal! Security screening was extremely slow and staff rude. I will avoid Heathrow in the future. Long flight to Abu Dhabi was ok, no frills in Premium Economy but edible food. Return flight was similar, but Heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time. My last flight on BA was over 30 years ago, it was a real premium carrier then."
599,E Smyth (United Kingdom) 30th April 2018,3/10,"""An average experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Overnight club world flight from Rio to London. Check in at Rio was efficient. Third party lounge (Premium plaza) which was reasonable and had enough space. No fast track security lanes in Rio. Plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding. On board, standard club world service. My feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to be. Granted they only loaded one of the wine options (which was wasn't great either). Food itself not terribly appetizing. Breakfast quite rushed, which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flight. Flight landed on time, priority bags worked and were off quickly. An average experience. However, BA were not the lowest cost option on this route (at the time of booking that was Air France- a carrier I rate highly), but they were a direct flight."
600,Vera Broussova (United Kingdom) 17th April 2018,5/10,"""this change is not acceptable""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Moscow. British Airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in Business class is no longer Club World (flat bed) seat but Club Europe seat (not flat bed). It is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable. I cannot fly during the day as I have meetings scheduled. BA has not offered a like for like change, they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day. Moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that BA is offering during the day. They also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date, like Friday when the seat (whether club world or club Europe) is less important as Saturday not a working day and one can get a rest. In Summary it is unacceptable that BA is charging more for the flights with Club World Seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change. This was never the case before and BA was fair previously."
601,P Steiger (United Kingdom) 16th April 2018,1/10,"""recent BA experience was positive""","✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London. My most recent BA experience was positive. I fly BA for work and leisure up to 4 long haul flights a year. On my most recent flight from Miami to LHR I found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the dated aircraft the 747-400. Which to me is the legend of the skies! The cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service, from the MIA ground handling American crew. Food and beverage service was good, seating in my aisle seat 29E generous for my long legs. I recently flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight. Well done BA you excel against the North American carriers on routes to the North American gateways who give just a basic service."

603,J Chekasul (United Kingdom) 15th April 2018,4/10,"""among the most greedy airlines""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Dallas. The aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so. Seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. The personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen, so I had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I saw some passengers request for more food, and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. Whilst AA is improving, BA is becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. The seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 star. It's not even worth redeeming Avios points anymore. These days I'd rather spend my Avios on partner airlines."
604,J Aberg (Sweden) 14th April 2018,4/10,"""the seat pitch is ridiculous""","✅ Trip Verified | Decided to go in Club Europe for this relatively short flight (90 minutes) from London to Copenhagen. Dropped my bags and went through security, which did not take too long. I then went to the Galleries Lounge (south), and although I have not been there for a year or two, it looked the same. Same food, same drinks, same slow wifi. My gate was just around the corner, and I got on the plane. I like the fresh look inside, but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business. The food service was disappointing. The service in the cabin was OK, but not very warm. I have travelled a lot with BA over the past 20 years, after yesterda I have lost my faith in British Airways."
605,M Owen (United Kingdom) 14th April 2018,3/10,"""it’s become a last resort""","✅ Trip Verified | BA used to be a byword for quality and service. You simply can’t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. I paid 600 dollars for my ticket from Istanbul to London with BA. For that price there is no airbridge (you will wait on a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 hour flight. Also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. Pegasus and AtlasGlobal offer a similar service to BA but at far lower prices. It seems to be the same all over. BA used to be a first choice but at this price, for this service, it’s become a last resort."
606,B Seares (United Kingdom) 13th April 2018,2/10,"""Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. I’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I’ve never had a good experience."

608,C Bowen (United Kingdom) 13th April 2018,1/10,"""Boarding was chaotic""",✅ Trip Verified | Naples to Gatwick. The online check-in would not work for me in accordance with the One World Frequent flyer policy. I am a Qantas frequent flyer and so I ought to have had the chance to check-in a few days ahead of the flight. The BA website would not let me do so. The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger. Disembarkation was slow and badly managed. Nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers. BA has become a low-cost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag I will not be using them again in a hurry.
609,C Norton (United Kingdom) 12th April 2018,4/10,"""Not value for money""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience. Thumbs down to BA."

Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. I managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight."
612,Muhammad Kajee (United Kingdom) 1st April 2018,7/10,"""entertainment was not working""","✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I travelled from Cape Town to London on the 10th March 2018. We have a 1 year old and a 4 year old. Once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not working. The cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. There was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. As it was a night flight, my wife and I had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. Any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. As BAs safety demonstration prior to take off is on video, we didn't receive this. The flight was the worst airline experience we've had. I doubt I'll ever fly with BA again."
613,P Dean (United Kingdom) 30th March 2018,1/10,"""staff try so very hard to please""","✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Madeira. The flight left on time and arrived early, slept as early morning flight. The plane was not very clean, grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats. The staff were pleasant. Breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate. The return was poorly organised, no use of fast track security for business class passengers. Long queue for boarding and a grubby plane. Really no point in paying for business class. The staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment, dog-eared magazines.  Quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration."
614,E Christie (United Kingdom) 30th March 2018,4/10,"""extremely unprofessional""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Casablanca. Their customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchy. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. TAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flight. I was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight I was rebooked was overbooked. However, later on I was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. They were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of BA. This is very rude and extremely unprofessional. I've never had this treatment during my 10+ years of flying with various airlines, both top rated and low cost carrier."

I travelled on BA985 from Berlin to Hong Kong via London on 19 Feb. Due to the snowy weather, my flight leaving Berlin to London was delayed, in which I was worried about missing my connecting flight from London to Hong Kong. During the flight, the manager came to me several times, explained to me the reason of flight delay, informed me about the connecting flight arrangements. Her information was very clear, trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on this. Very much appreciated for their service."

For me quality hit the rock bottom. Especially the unclean flight. I would have preferred the aircraft from Brussels to London and vice versa for the long haul travel. Maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price I paid for ticket I think it's not worth it. Other airline which I used to travel had the same price and if I compare the services of that ariline I regret choosing British Airways.
617,David Ellis (United Kingdom) 24th March 2018,2/10,"""an entirely reasonable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is one of BA's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. From September 2018, the Gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced Club World. The 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard 90s vintage, which meant 48 pax squeezed into the Club World cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient, small screen, low resolution IFE that required the usual rebooting. But there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved Club World food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at Fort Lauderdale terminal 4. Overall, an entirely reasonable flight."

I thought service in the sky had died out. As a frequent flyer I haven’t felt the needed to complain nor commend until now. I had to say something, to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights I have ever had. This is old school airline service, puts the glamour and luxury back into air travel. Cabin staff made me feel like I was the only person they were serving. I loved the humour, the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes."
620,K King (Germany) 13th March 2018,5/10,"""Worn seats, cracks in the walls""","✅ Trip Verified | Very full flight on G-BNLP/B747 flying from Miami to London. According to BAsource.com this plane was built in 1990. Obviously, since then it was not refurbished. Felt like a teenager again. Worn seats, cracks in the walls and dirty. Additonally, the IFE did not work. At the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment. As the night approached, crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. No IFE and no book reading possible. Crew were young and friendly, but obviously not experienced. Took 2.5 hours until we had our meal after take-off - they skipped our last four rows. Only after inquiring we got a tray. On arrival, new contractor at Terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available. Needed to wait 20 minutes until someone arrived. Overall, poor experience with British Airways. They used to be good, but they try to be low-cost and charge legacy carrier prices. Will not work. To fly, to serve is no more adequate as their slogan."

WAW is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control “Bolero” is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport. BA have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly. Seat in club Europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch - frankly it’s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats. The service was very good, attentive and prompt. The food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert and cheese course with drinks flowing, frankly well above expected."

The crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers, but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there. They should smile and be a little more considerate. However, the check-in lady was nice and we had a laugh. My problem with BA, for a while now, is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights."

The air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came. When I asked another air steward for a bottle of water, he told me they don't have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal. Was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight?"

I am a frequent traveller but this was the first time I have traveled with British Airways and it did not disappoint me. The flight departed on time and caused no extra delays whatsoever despite the dreadful weather conditions in Toronto. The cabin crews were wonderful and the service were great. The seat aren't the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for money is good too.
627,C Martin (United Kingdom) 1st March 2018,6/10,"""my worst experience in business class""",✅ Trip Verified | I flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hong Kong in Club World on a A380. They have recently introduced the new Club World service on this route and it was a complete disaster. It took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight. They ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold. The cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn’t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients. Overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new BA concept doesn’t seem to work well (it was even criticised by the crew during the flight). I am gold on BA and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future.

The Premium Economy cabin is located on the upper deck. I had a side seat with no one sitting next to me. Boarding was smooth and we left on time. Food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll, which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which I didn't eat, my dog liked it when I got home. For the price, you would expect a better meal. IFE was fine. Crew good."

Upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in I was disappointed to see no separate check in. just a young girl with a couldn't care less attitude behind a temporary room divider. Off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious, uninterested staff on the door, huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago. The lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good. On board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first - was followed by a filthy seat, a screen that wouldn't stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me. Our return in Club from New Orleans was not much better, no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest. I love BA onboard crew in general but I will never fly BA again."
630,O Thompson (United Kingdom) 15th February 2018,5/10,"""food has noticeably improved""","✅ Trip Verified | A fairly average flight to Cape Town and return. The old 777s they use out of Gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. The TV screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is OK. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. As always with BA the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly, others were borderline rude. However I would probably still choose BA to Cape Town in order to fly direct."

They both smelt revolting and I didn't even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldn't eat anymore. Chicken curry was questionable or again Spinach Lasagne - just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesn't mean they what spinach with every meal, there are some very nice alternatives out there. We were not offered Tea or Coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive. I would think twice before traveling with BA again. I thought they were meant to be our flagship Airline."

The chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour. It was mainly just rice. The biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar - no fruit bits in it - just like eating sawdust. Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten. I commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising. Come on guys - even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel? What planet are you on?

636,H Shaugur (India) 6th February 2018,10/10,"""cabin staff polite and friendly""","✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Hyderabad via London Heathrow. All flights left on time but the HYD-LHR one arrived an hour late. I literally had to run to find my way through Heathrow to to board my connection. As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. My only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very late. It was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. That kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. Toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. However, I wasn't impressed by the seats in BA flights. I found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia). I also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough. The AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia had Bose noise canceling headphones, while the BA flights had just regular ones. No big deal, but still."

I had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try British Airways instead of taking my regular Emirates. The flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. The customer care was unresponsive. I have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. I had to go book Emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in price. I wrote email to customer care. It has taken so much time to get a response from them. The bad part is they won’t refund your ticket price. I hope no one goes through such similar issue. My honest opinion: Be sure of your travel plans before you book British Airways. I was my first and last journey. I wont recommend personally to anyone.

On this occasion, I had invested in an upgrade and as such I expected nothing less. For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their offer of compensation was £200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future. Their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values: “Meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming British Airways into the world's leading global premium airline. Our investment in our staff, our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service.” The experience with BA has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday!

This flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class: passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet. Why pay more to fly business then? Dreadful! Flew in from Chicago to Heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest I’ve ever seen and with awful food. The controls in my first class seat did not work either. British Airways is fast going down the drains. Avoid!

642,S Porter (Canada) 20th January 2018,1/10,"""Six hours before it was cancelled""","✅ Trip Verified |  I was due to fly London Heathrow to Vancouver Jan 7th.  Six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelled. When I called in (after waiting for 45 minutes on hold), I was told it was due to 'Operational Requirements'. A lot of back and forth, but the bottom line, BA could not get me back to YVR until Thursday. I could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-book. Or they could fly me into Seattle on Tuesday and I must make my way home from there on my own dime, and I could submit for reimbursement from BA - no guarantees they will reimburse though. I was told when BA cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs there and at home. I am flying Air Canada when I return to the UK in February. At least if they cancel my flight, they will make a better effort to get me back home."

We tried to check in on line and were unable to. When we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to Costa Rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airport. This flight had been booked since March 2017 and no one had raised this The assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage. We were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to Madrid the seats were the same as Economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat. We were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard We were, we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in Club World. We were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats that's just greedy."

I was unable to file a claim upon arrival because BA 940 was delayed and I had to catch a train to Osnabrück but was told I could file online. That is incorrect because the online system doesn't accept American Airlines strap tag numbers. I tried to call the number I was given but the agents in Madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after I explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the DUS baggage office. I called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claim. Finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. However, I did not still see my suitcase until four days later. Now I am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred (toiletries, underwear, doctor's consultation, and replacement medication).

Between 3-4am in the morning, I went in search of snacks. Found the cabin staff in the kitchen area. When I asked, please may I have some snacks, I was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. Not one them got up to assist, not one of them had replaced any of the snacks (the counter was empty, only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs), they kept serving the person next to me, over me instead of going around me, didn't matter that they blocked my viewing - that is fine and understandable, but no excuse me, please can we, nothing.

I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. Boarding at Heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy. On board I offered a pre Champagne or water. Once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts. Meal pre ordered online. I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. There rapid response and actions probably saved his life, I flew on 12 January. Well done BA, you are pulling in the right direction again."

British Airways is always a good choice. I was flying business class from LGW to FCO, everything was excellent! The crew were really nice for the whole flight, I was travelling solo and I had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food. We got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice (I got champagne and salmon!) everything was lly tasty. We departed and landed on time (with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports, and I really appreciate this every time.)

Had originally booked in Premium Economy but received upgrade offers from British Airways that were too go to pass up. Extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided. Glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. Cabin crew came by constantly to see how I was doing on both legs. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. The seat itself was not as wide as I anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. The 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. Comfortable and quiet. Fast track passes an added plus. Flying out of San Jose is a bonus since I'm a ten minute drive to home. Overall very pleased with British Airways and the service provided. Access to lounges at both airports another plus ! No complaints from me. Will look to fly BA again later this year.

Sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to get to the aisle. Product must be about 15 years out of date. Food was of poor quality. No mid-flight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches.  Second meal was tiny. Arrived at a bus gate in London. No bus appeared for about 30 minutes. Crew blamed the bus providing company. Overall an awful experience I do not intend to repeat.
650,Allan Gittens (United Kingdom) 5th January 2018,5/10,"""I was pleasantly surprised""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around £130 more than Emirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journey. The A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested. Inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard WiFi is a big letdown too. Food was standard airline food, neither good or bad but ok. BA has been taken over for air travel by the big middle Eastern airlines, but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again - long haul only."
651,Christine Johnson (United Kingdom) 3rd January 2018,8/10,"""BA is now as bad as Ryanair""",✅ Trip Verified |  Will never fly with BA again. Outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos. Our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. Cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn't have been in service. I agree. Flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. No assistance provided by BA. Told it wasn't there problem and sort my own accommodation out. Took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. Was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for. BA is now as bad as Ryanair so will never fly with them again. They're charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service.

I have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of British Airways. I landed in Tel Aviv and waited one hour for my bag to appear and when it didn’t, I went to the QAS counter and gave them my information. For three days, my bag was in London before reaching Tel Aviv, and then the driver didn’t bring my bag to where I was staying."

B Muller (United Kingdom) 1st January 2018",1/10,"""I was sorely disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew Premium Economy from London to Cape Town on British Airways. Having flown Premium Economy before, I had certain expectations of what I would be getting, but I was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive Premium Economy I have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worst. The plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. From Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where I was constantly pushing against it. I finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. The personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones - the screen was tiny, the blind next to me could not be pulled down. The headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that I spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in, so that I could actually hear anything. Expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. I find it shocking that BA charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. I needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times, with no success, I phoned BA and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which I gave up and just cancelled the flight, which worked first time. I booked a flight on another airline and for just £200 more, I got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant."

As usual the did the standard in Dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn’t - after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadn’t started. Again, as usual, Club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad. Today as a special treat they hadn’t heated the paninis for my row - so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients. And finally they ran out of champagne- about the only advantage left of club."

Aircraft was very dated, IFE poor, meal service average, no snacks, poor drinks service, crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. Seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we’re outdated a decade ago. The meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years. To top everything off the crew couldn’t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! When you tell BA about a negative experience they’ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint - absolute waste of time - don’t waste your money flying BA - I’ve had far more positive experiences on Ryanair."

They changed my return flight by more than 4 hours. When I asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there. Called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy. Then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes. Wonder what they do with the miles. The worst business class I have flown. Never buy their premium class. Lounge in London is worse than the free lounge an American Express card provides. What the heck is wrong with them?

Glasses of champagne/wine offered on arrival, and the food was quite good. The attendants were polite. Inflight entertainment was decent, I especially liked the ""Festive Season"" section, which had a variety of holiday/Christmas movies. Plane left and arrived on time.

J Reames (United States) 5th December 2017",5/10,"""morphing into a low-cost carrier""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Rome. It's been a while since I last flew on BA and it certainly has changed. While the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. It seems that BA is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as European destinations are concerned. Presumably, this is due to the competition from Easyjet and Ryanair as well as it's CEO hailing from Vueling. I suppose it's only fair given that the fare was as cheap as the other two and BA flies out of LHR."

The ground service was really poor even thought I used premium counter (Sapphire status of OW).  I paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom, however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak English. Staff could not distinguish the Taiwan passport from the China passport and keep said that we need Visa to go to Spain. It took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad. The worst staff I had  met. Although BA sold a very expensive ticket, however, even a cup of water you have to pay for it. I would never choose this airline again."
665,Heidy Lopez (Canada) 3rd December 2017,1/10,"""the worst travel experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage.  They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver."
666,T Mallison (United Kingdom) 2nd December 2017,3/10,"""Noticeable cost cutting measures""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Berlin Tegel return. It's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between British Airways and the budget airlines. The only saving grace is that I've never experienced any issues flying out of or into T5. Noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, BA have removed a toilet in economy within their A319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgraceful. My flight to Berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldn't offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats. I feel for the staff who often work tirelessly."
667,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 1st December 2017,2/10,"""1st product is very mediocre""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Arrived at the new ""Wing"" at T5. A quick process and into the Concorde lounge. I noticed (as before) the check in staff do not mention the Concorde lounge per se. ""Just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge."" This option was rammed. Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. It looks a bit better. Had a snack and a few glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal B. Friendly FA showed me and wife to our seats. Looked freshly cleaned. Pushed back on time. 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was nice. Some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. Cheese and biscuits to conclude. Wines were ok. The seat (the new ""First"") - is not wearing well. Looking somewhat tired. Managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. I am a tall guy and need the space. the Club World option is horrendous. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. Readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. If Mr Cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. The flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. The 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort of an upmarket Business class"". I'd agree with that. One would think, BA would want to make a big impression on this route - with at least some high end food. ""Logic"" is not something BA seem to understand - given the high level of negative reviews on this site. Very disappointing."
668,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 1st December 2017,2/10,"""sad experience from our national carrier""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. Arrived at Dubai airport, checked in - and endured horrendous security. Not BAs fault. Walked miles to the ""new"" lounge. It's a weird set up. You walk through the Club option, with a considerable variation of food - to a tiny room with small options of food. Seating very mediocre. Made our way to the plane. Departed bang on time. Airbourne I went for lunch straight away - after a couple of G&Ts. Arabic lamb starter. Boring and tasteless. No other options. Skipped the soup. Had a salad. The beef mains was very good - not exceptional and no wow factor. Just nice. Red wine was OK - mid priced stuff at about £25 a bottle. My wife was told the beef was now ""unavailable"". My friend had beef and so did I - when challenged on this I was told - only 3 beefs aboard! This flight was again full and had been for weeks. 14 people. 3 beefs. A joke. My wife had an Arab dish which she did not like. When it came to coffee, my friend, then I - had a choice of chocolates. My wife then had the box offered - only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy FA. Most BA cabin staff are good - this one was a PR disaster. Flight was smooth all the way home. Another sad experience from our national carrier. Definitely not worth some of the extreme prices posted for this route."
669,Jenny Bentley (United Kingdom) 1st December 2017,3/10,"""BA quality is severely lacking""",✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Saint Lucia to London Gatwick. Agree with other recent reviews: BA quality is severely lacking compared to other Oneworld carrier’s business class. We were not addressed by name. Staff seemed rushed and not proactive at all: had to ask for anything we required. Not all breakfast items were available. Seat space and comfort seriously under par. Nobody came to collect rubbish prior to landing so it remained on the floor in front of me. Did not feel like valued customers.
670,Corey Diffin (Singapore) 24th November 2017,5/10,"""British Airways is seriously lacking""","✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is seriously lacking in all areas. Singapore to Sydney return in economy. Fly the route often, usually with Qantas which are great. The flight out to Sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night - most people are looking to maximise their sleep. Especially those who have come from London. Cabin crew were surly, unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised. After departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest. During the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep. The food is very average also. Two hours before landing, they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic. No tea or coffee. The competition is too strong for this route. I would never use them again."
671,H Peel (United Kingdom) 24th November 2017,3/10,"""BA is shameless and embarrassing""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Basel. Boarding: There are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (The new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further.) Since I was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, I found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. Yes, BA appears intent on replicating England's class system!  On board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a French ATC strike. Obviously, this was not BA's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. After take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. Why BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. The no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. The trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. End of service. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the premium seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. It wasn't until I had left the airport that I was able to get that cup of tea. Needless to say, Eurowings and EasyJet do things much better."
672,William Beard (United Kingdom) 24th November 2017,1/10,"""poor quality product crew have to support""","✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London Heathrow. A bit of a mixed bag. Boarding at Miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! So much for safety. Seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at Heathrow. Also my wife’s IFE failed mid flight. Impossible to hear information from the flight deck. These ageing 747’s really are in desperate need of replacement. The congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. The minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired. The only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew. They must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support. Flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly."
673,D Karnda (United States) 23rd November 2017,3/10,"""the worst airline I have flown""","✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to Washington via London. British Airways has turned out to be the worst airline I have flown. Unfortunately I am forced to fly them often from PRG, if I want to connect on their One World partner AA, which I have Exec Plat status with. BA charges for everything, including water. PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier. London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. Had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat. Food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips. Entertainment system has about 40 movies, compared to about 200 options on AA flights. Overall horrible experience. The extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only? They charge USD 100 for a checked in luggage even to Emerald partners?  Horrible food, aircraft, LHR and transfer experience. Good luck BA, will avoid at all costs. Included a picture from the bathroom which was broken."
674,David Ellis (United Kingdom) 23rd November 2017,1/10,"""An excellent flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Cape Town to London. I can report a positive experience on our flight. From the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. Seats 4E/F suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. Glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. The menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. Talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. The IFE screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. Still no WiFi, of course. Take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism. An excellent flight, overall."
675,B Mantourieux (Thailand) 21st November 2017,9/10,"""the CEO is running BA to the ground""","✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. It is clear to me the CEO is running BA to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later ."

We passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. I had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. At such an unsociable hour of the morning, I could no longer disturb her. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. On arrival, I was brusquely told by a BA rep to go online and find my own accommodation. After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. I was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where I should have been. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working). Also had I known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. Further wait. Not only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination. I hadn't even counted the extra taxi bills I incurred (£45) - but I did expect BA to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture. Not impressed."

C Down (United Kingdom) 20th November 2017",2/10,"""solid product and excellent crew""","✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel. I used Avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money."
679,C Down (United Kingdom) 20th November 2017,7/10,"""was a very enjoyable flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. Overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as I booked using Avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money. Having said that, I would have still considered it good value even if paying cash."

Richard Clarke (Saudi Arabia) 15th November 2017",5/10,"""Cost cutting was in evidence""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates, Etihad which are far more superior. The plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing. On this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff. Cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get, the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone. It's more akin to economy, also a real negative point is your at Heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses! A shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport. This flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit. Plane was delayed 45 mins & arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either. IFE was poor with old films that they call new releases, no where near on a par with Qatar Airways."

Ticket booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £2.5k in business class return so very good value. Positives - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFE. Cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful. T5 Lounge fine, flight on time. Bags off very quickly. Negatives - food on on both legs wasn't great. Salad poor and main beef meal very average. Pudding which is normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. The real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't have to as they were done for the day. BA are getting so much stick at the moment - their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of £15k. The crew lift this product to a much higher level."

R Wathardar (United Kingdom) 13th November 2017",8/10,"""extra cost not justified""","✅ Verified Review |  British Airways short haul Business Class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. So is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges). Priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. Having maneuvered into the cramped seat, I was offered a hot towel as soon as I sat down. I couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. It was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. But I guess it was something different BA was trying out. The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. Soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. The service was good, considering a one hour flight. Despite a Boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. To me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. How can this be branded as Business Class? Is the extra cost justified to fly Club Europe? Absolutely not."
683,Komalpreet Gill (United Kingdom) 13th November 2017,2/10,"""requested Asian vegetarian food""","✅ Verified Review |  I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled.  I was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. When I reached Phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in, then down to go through security again to board my flight. On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage, so please keep it unlocked.  I requested Asian vegetarian food but when I got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet. When I mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said that’s what you asked for but I said sorry I didn’t as on the food label clearly says 18A and my seat no is 18K so how is this my food. She still didn’t believe me instead of apology she said I have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you. After 15 mins of wait once she serving all the passengers she came to me and told me that if you want I can offer you full English breakfast I said but I am vegetarian she said I don’t have any other option."

Derek Northcutt (United States) 13th November 2017",1/10,"""continually disappointed by British Airways""","✅ Verified Review |  Am continually disappointed by British Airways. It seems they are now in a race with Ryanair and easyJet to become the worst carrier in and out of the UK. Flew Düsseldorf to London. Their lounge at DUS is closed but their check-in staff doesn't know that (she sent me up there). I have a connexion at JFK and I showed her the boarding passes but she wouldn't interline my bag to their partner AA and I had to recheck it. Now, not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11-hour flight LHR-LAX, but now they want £2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for. Usually, you should always fly across the ocean on a European carrier, but with BOAC I recommend Finnair or American with their One World alliance. What is the point?"
685,G Searle (United Kingdom) 11th November 2017,2/10,"""need to clean the planes more often""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration."
686,Mike Randall (United Kingdom) 11th November 2017,6/10,"""Complete rip-off sums it up""","✅ Verified Review |  London to New York JFK in club world. After reading very mixed reviews here, I also saw that BA were upgrading standards on flights to NYC in particular and was looking forward to my flight. Should not have been so optimistic, as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980's. Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket. BA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even when you pay to-dollar for business class the standards are well below even their US counterparts. Complete rip-off sums it up."
687,Yuriy Karpov (United States) 10th November 2017,3/10,"""exactly the same width and pitch""","✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I booked two round trip business class air tickets from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls with British Airways / Comair. It turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class: they had exactly the same width and pitch! Actually, British Airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain, and called this a business class! Moreover, our pre-flight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because British Airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in Victoria Falls. Yes, during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks, but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets $1,372 rather than $703, which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets?"
688,C Ward  (United Kingdom) 10th November 2017,1/10,"""disappointed with the return flight""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc. - The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. - Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen, then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. This was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was  faulty. The usual 'push and release' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen, it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would  open, this happened during take off and landing, as well as throughout the flight.  For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class. We have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our American Express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher, for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. Whilst the outbound flight was great, I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. The hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact, the situation got worse. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re-set; after that, the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight. As you can imagine, it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it. It was impossible to turn the screen off completely."
689,Mubashira Bukhari Khwaja (United Kingdom) 9th November 2017,1/10,"""They were refused boarding""","✅ Verified Review |  I travelled to Johannesburg from London Heathrow on Sunday 22nd October on flight BA55 and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd October. They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to South Africa. There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking. Other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive, even though both my husband and I are frequent travellers and have Silver cards of their Executive program. I will avoid travelling BA even for work after this event. Have received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past."
690,S Hammis (United Kingdom) 31st October 2017,5/10,"""I will not use BA again""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech, the cabin crew was lazy and rude, refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds . For the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped. Half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu. The lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customers. After 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn’t finished serving other customers even though none of the 3 staff members was seen serving anyone. We waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored. After another 10 Minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving. We tried for over 1 hour to buy some Jaffa cakes which would have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask for. Ryanair or EasyJet Service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew. I will not use BA again if I can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline ."

I was able to secure a window seat for myself (without paying any fee) during online check-in 24 hours prior to departure. The baggage drop-off experience at LAX and LHR was smooth. At LAX, the BA staff tags your check-in bags, at LHR, you have to do it yourself. The on-board experience was good. This was my first time sitting on the upper-deck of A380 (which had a special storage bin by the window armrest). Food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights (Chicken or Pasta). There was no WiFi, but BA had a good collection of movies. I enjoyed BA's in-flight ""movie snack"" as well. The ""Flight Map / Tracker"" wasn't working on one segment, which was a bit surprising. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with BA again."
692,C Barton (United Kingdom) 29th October 2017,8/10,"""pleasant and well organised""",✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair. The website was easy to use and very clear. I checked-in online and simply had to drop off my bag. I arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already. The boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean. My seat was comfortable for a short flight. The captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew I could see worked very hard and were pleasant. The crew made use of Italian and were cheerful and professional. My gripe is the awful use of Marks and Spencer food. This has to be purchased and a good few items were not available. There were no route maps and no entertainment systems. The lavatory was clean. Disembarkation was managed well.
693,K Chater (United States) 28th October 2017,7/10,"""deplorable customer service""","✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick. We received deplorable customer service recently from British Airways. I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ). Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed on October 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160. We were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers. Apparently British Airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense."

W Neeley (United Kingdom) 27th October 2017",1/10,"""gripe is about the current food service""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London. If BA want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it."

British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days. When I pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that I get a 20% discount voucher from my next flight price, they said this is something British Airways do not offer."
697,K Gaulin (Singapore) 25th October 2017,3/10,"""a dismal airline to fly with""","✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Nassau via Heathrow. British Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. One can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time. It could learn well from airlines like Singapore Airlines which are pretty consistent and clean. I am giving the airline 4 of 10 only for value for money."

I have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the phone offered an alternative flight from another airport. No assistance for transport."

S Porter (United Kingdom) 19th October 2017",5/10,"""very pleasant crew ""","✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Gatwick. Our return trip from holiday was equally pleasant. Check-in at Malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet Sunday. VIP lounge at Malaga used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there) is pretty useless compared with the old BA lounge that used to be there - cost cutting ?? Guess we were spoiled by Gatwick !! Drink okay but limited, food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious. Flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due I guess to help from Hurricane Ophelia which I guess we were on the fringe of. In board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew - chatted to the First Officer, nice man. All in all we were well looked after in this Class so can't complain."

S Porter (United Kingdom) 18th October 2017",10/10,"""food was well presented""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Malaga. First flight with BA from new home at South Terminal at London Gatwick. Upon arrival at check-in at 6:30 a.m was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with Business class passengers resulting in a 20 minute wait to sort out our bags. However, Fast Track through Customs was efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation. New lounge in South Terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality, although sadly, the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks. A319 to Malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality. We arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complain. Overall flight quality has to be excellent."
702,N Jeffery (France) 17th October 2017,10/10,"""Deliberate extortion""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Nice. Deliberate extortion by BA in my opinion. I booked an economy basic return from Nice to London with BA. Days before the outbound I had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier. I ended up buying a new single outbound flight as BA app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight. In the UK I received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from BA. However app again gave up and said I had logged in too many times. Upon arrival at Heathrow I was told BA had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings. They said I had to pay approx £350 to buy a new single ticket home, even after I explained my situation. I argued that had I been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did I could have at least bought a cheaper flight. Even the day before when I got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper. Eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for £122 (charging me again for taxes). As i needed to get back and there was no time to go to Gatwick for cheaper flight I had no choice but to pay. Terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when I asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t&c he said he would not like to comment."

G Peel (United Kingdom) 17th October 2017",1/10,"""depths to which BA have descended""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight.  We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. We are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. You almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. We should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. The return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAP. The service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. My wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas I at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. The entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows its age. This flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. BA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. It will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right. We will probably never fly BA long-haul business class (Club World) again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re-configure their seating!"
704,K Lanson (United Kingdom) 17th October 2017,3/10,"""I won't fly with them again""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Abu Dhabi. I told BA at check-in that I would be interested in upgrading to Premium Economy if a window seat was available. The lady replied ""can I check - you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window"". I replied yes. After a series of phone calls, the upgrade was processed (I paid 149 GBP). My seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of Premium Economy where the toilets should be. When I complained, I was told that seats could not be guaranteed so I had no complaint. No refund offered, no token gesture offered, nothing. The food was nice and the seat was very comfortable. If it wasn't for the rude customer service I would fly again. I was led to believe I could pay for a window seat and I paid in good faith. I've flown BA for years, but this year has been disappointing. I won't fly with them again."

C Down (United Kingdom) 15th October 2017",2/10,"""Overall a good flight""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Faro. Pretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good value. Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while. Priority baggage didn’t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags. Overall a good flight."
706,Paul Dreyfuss (United Kingdom) 13th October 2017,8/10,"""true case of rip-off BA""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Madrid in economy class. Late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from Heathrow. Online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay. Boarding quite efficient. Cabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. Everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. Staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. I wouldn't have minded on a cheap ticket, but this was not a true case of rip-off BA in 2017. Will avoid if possible."
707,B Davis (United Kingdom) 12th October 2017,3/10,"""staff were insanely rude2","✅ Verified Review | I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected. Then, on Monday, I was ordered to pay £65 (83 Francs). Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest, the supervisor particularly). Their customer service is also awful. It's a joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeks. They only responded when I chased them up, said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. Can you believe that? The explanation was their IT system failed in May 2017, an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved."
708,S Laiken (Cayman Islands) 11th October 2017,1/10,"""truly disappointed with BA""","✅ Verified Review |  Grand Cayman to London. I can't comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the Atlantic Ocean, only allows 1 check in free bag for economy class. Upon returning to GCM from LON on October 6, 2017, I had to pay £290 for additional baggage.  Particularly for university students (such as myself) who migrate from such distances to achieve good education.  In addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage, has BA gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush, toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights? That was one of the things I appreciated most about BA as it made me feel valued. I am truly disappointed with BA these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to LON from GCM you guarantee I WILL abandon BA!"

When I boarded the plane, I notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my. I assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep, ear plugs, maybe a small tube of toothpaste. Here you have some headphones and that's all. With British Airways, you can order some special meals. I received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast. One of the cabin crew asked me if I ordered a special meal. The plane looked quite old. I tried BA, never again."
710,Samuele Scagnetti (United Kingdom) 29th September 2017,5/10,"""now worse than Ryanair""","✅ Verified Review |  Geneva to London. British Airways used to be my favourite airline, however, over the last 2 years I have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights I have had with them. I do fly with BA about 30 times a year. In this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities) I was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind I was flying at 7am the morning after. Their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight. I must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy. When I managed to connect I have had to hold for an hour before the line died. I have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. Horrible customer service by the way, the person I was talking to couldn't care less. I was originally flying in business and I was placed in economy instead. I was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions (a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries) and promised a refund on the fare which to date (about 4 months later) has still not happened. If you call them they transfer your call to India where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help. What once was the best airline is now worse than Ryanair. Avoid if possible"
711,G Graham (United Kingdom) 27th September 2017,1/10,"""used to be a nice airline""","✅ Verified Review | BA used to be a nice airline with great customer service, those days are long gone. If you fly in their ""business class"" you will get what you used to get in economy 5 years ago: same leg space, same food, same drinks. Forget about a welcome drink before take off, 3 course dinner (was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight) and personalized service. Economy class is just like easyjet or Ryanair, but you will pay much less for the latter ones. Shame."
712,Paul Taylor (United Kingdom) 27th September 2017,3/10,"""BA has fallen even lower""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to New York. After reading reviews I was hoping some were inaccurate, but after this flight in Club World I realise that BA has fallen even lower than many have said. Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these. Luckily, I am leaving the USA to Asia from Los Angeles next week on Eva Air and expecting a big step up in standards."

T Lanescu (Romania) 26th September 2017",3/10,"""was a good experience""","✅ Verified Review |  Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia was a good experience. I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. I had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. I told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look into. In-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lot. I had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat, who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat, sometimes talked louder than necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers. There were minor issues during check-in at the departure airport in Port of Spain, the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as I have a gold card on Oneworld. To use the lounge I had to use my Priority Pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff. I was flying further from Gatwick to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, hoping I would not have to change airports in London and as a result go through immigration, take the baggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn't have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process."
714,Douglas Day (United Kingdom) 26th September 2017,9/10,"""Simply appalling""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Chicago. Simply appalling. Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 with Premium Economy adjacent to First Class. Cabin was filthy, and carpets coming up. Food was inedible. The IFE system was old, slow, and low resolution. No wireless of course, either. British Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselves. For them to call it ""First Class"" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extreme. These old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely A380, and the entire First Class and Club Class product should be reviewed / enhanced. But of course, this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the Atlantic."
715,T Mallon (United Kingdom) 26th September 2017,1/10,"""on a par with low cost carriers""","✅ Verified Review |  Jersey to Gatwick. Flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern. The crew were friendly. The flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but I’m not sure they made it to the final rows. I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). I still don’t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew’s fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal. The BA offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy."

The seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch. The aircraft was clean. Cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods.

Aircraft long haul new and clean, short haul a bit old, but still acceptable. Crew overall are lovely, pleasant service. BA food is on the top of the rank. Kuala Lumpur to London My boyfriend and I got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast. Also very tasty. We got 2 wines and so many juices. Return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta. Again, it flavorful. And we got beef congee and Engliah breakfast before we landed. Short hauls don't have any food. Inflight entertainment not the best, but still acceptable. Short hauls don't have any screens. Only thing I don't like is the seats. Economy seats are small. I have no problem with it since I am a petite girl, but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up. If I knew before, I will book a premium economy, that one seems nicer and have more space. I got the best price for round trip, value for money!"

720,C Rankin (United States) 12th September 2017,5/10,"""airline is clearly failing fast""",✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to London. I am a regular BA flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a Tier 2 airline. The journey started in the Concorde lounge Dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours I was there was not refreshed. Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price. Very disappointing and they don't care.

Rob Minter (United Kingdom) 11th September 2017",9/10,"""they are just an embarrassment""","✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Funchal. In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. They have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. And that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. On our flights to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that's in the next part of the BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete."

Beetroot carpaccio with Goats cheese, melt in mouth Ox Cheek, poor desert again. Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight. A bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will. This kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues. One pays more for more toilets. Kids in dire need, ok, adults No! Time made up almost, T5 quite quick again so another good experience for us with BA. Cheers."
724,Alan Wan (United Kingdom) 9th September 2017,8/10,"""expensive at £343 return""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Belfast City to London Heathrow. First time I flew from Belfast and it's a great little airport. I had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty good. It was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken, smoked salmon, egg, etc. The bar was well stocked including Fever Tree tonic and Grey Goose vodka. Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late. This was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at £343 return. But as a Gold member I got most of the business class benefits."

Drink choices perfectly adequate. Staff very helpful and cordial. Flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early. Cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The seats must be the most talked about issue for BA club world. They do indeed ""pack them in"" compared to any other business class flight I have taken. That said, seats fully reclined, I had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable. Aside from take-off and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler. Cost of flight was 30-50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good.

Carpaccio of melon with a prawn, miso cod, not overcooked, wasabi mash and veg. Average dessert and cheese and crackers. Wine topped up regularly. Coffee in a mug. All through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin. Priority offload and separate bus to terminal.

727,H Cole (United Kingdom) 6th September 2017,9/10,"""wonderful member of crew""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver. I booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable. Our outward flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hour. We were seated on the top deck and I was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle seats). The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok. We had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep. He was drenched and I had no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn't be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight. She really made what could have been a stressful situation much easier and her positive friendly attitude really helped me out. I was pleasently surprised by BA on both legs of our journey and I wouldn't hesitate to book with them again, just a shame they can't up their game food wise."

Tasmin Symons (United Kingdom) 6th September 2017",8/10,"""exceptionally ordinary flight""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Sao Paulo. An exceptionally ordinary flight, both for good and for bad. Cabin crew were disinterested -- I was made to feel intrusive when I asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service -- something I'd never felt before. I felt somewhat snubbed when, after asking for help (being short) loading my (exit-row) hand luggage into the OHLs the FA took heed of an older woman telling him her bag had ""two tablets in and is fragile"" so should be stacked on top of mine, and didn't bother to ask me about the contents of my bag -- my laptop speakers haven't worked since. I slept through dinner service, but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast. A continental/charcuterie option would go down a treat on this route, I imagine, but we had a choice of flaccid English breakfast or flaccid omelette. My first BA economy flight after travelling long-haul in Premium economy and Club cabins. I can see why this is the bargain fare, but still better than several competitors. I felt safe, we arrived early, the crew were (for the most part) friendly. What's more to ask for."

730,S Copelan (United Kingdom) 27th August 2017,5/10,"""your budget airline status""","✅ Verified Review |  Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow. This was the return leg of a code share flight with JAL. I flew JAL on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious. On my return I felt embarrassed that BA is our national airline, mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality. White fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of 'fish' surrounded by a brown, fatty unidentifiable, flavourless mass. The tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush. Service was efficient, bordering on perfunctory. Luckily we brought some other food on board. Please BA, either do away with long haul meals altogether as mooted and declare your budget airline status or serve more appetising, less embarrassing fare. You can't stay 'stuck in the middle' for long!"

Flew Rome to London Heathrow. Compared to the likes of Qatar, Emirates and Qantas they do not come close. I will never travel with British Airways again. Flights delayed from London to Rome by over 1hr, between 2 captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditions. The food is shocking and over priced. The planes are out dated. There stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff."

K Teale (United Kingdom) 24th August 2017",1/10,"""flight was pretty regular""","✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Gatwick. Check in was easy thanks to fast help from the check-in desk. The staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time. The welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor). The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while. This is a great shame for a good looking cabin. We took off twenty minutes after the intended time, due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time. However, the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay, and the current progress in making up the lost time. Overall the flight was pretty regular from BA, but the good ground staff, useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew, made it a good service."

I have flown 14 times with British Airways in the last 5 months. I've seen a noticeable degradation of service. Flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down.

Even worse when you put it in context of what British Airways used to be. We decided to fly First  because I can't stand Club world (backward seats, forward facing seats almost on the aisle),  claustrophic, poor overhead storage on some planes. Seats were  narrow, poor seat controls (unable to independently control the different seat axes, foot rest had to be set manually), American Airlines and Cathay Pacific new business class products are far better than BA first class. AVOD great on one leg with the new Pansonic system, dreadful on the 2nd leg with the old system.  Food was mediocre at best. Breakfast JFK to LHR was passable, dinner LHR to CPT passible - wife's fish was okay my hamburger was inedible. Meal service slow. Cabin Crew from JFK was excellent, to Cape Town was passable.

Cabin was unclean with earbuds and paper on floor from previous flight. No hello for Gold status. It became clear British Airways are some sort of work to rule. One stewardess for all upstairs.

736,S Ballimore (United Kingdom) 21st August 2017,2/10,"""positive first experience""","✅ Verified Review |  Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the future. When I booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. My criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future."

Flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and BA handling in Salzburg did apologise for the delay. Once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members, 2 to serve Club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers. Usual fight for bag space. I was desperate for some water and asked the crew can I buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin. I am in seat 23C right at the back. I am told no, I have to wait for the trolley. I wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to Gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20. The 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments, and tell row 20 that the service is now closed, and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. All this as the CSD stands chatting in the Club galley with the other crew member. 1/4 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight. No smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. Not even a flight map to help pass time. Terrible airline. A national disgrace, worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service.  I am only rating this as 2/10 as they got me from A to B safely."

You must downgrade your rating of British Airways if you truly reflect how bad things have become. Flight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality. Once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible. Aside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads (most unpleasant in a confined space), their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude. They seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us, and that is just not acceptable. Sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness. BA management should be fired, or at least the CEO, Mr Cruz, who is destroying our national airline. I'm not a grumpy old man, just a customer with over 50 years experience of flying British Airways (and BOAC and BEA), and a direct witness to the demise of what was a great airline."

Woken at 7am by text to say 13.30 flight to Heathrow cancelled for operational reasons - phone numbers listed to rearrange. One not open till 9am GMT, the Greek one no longer in use. Website also useless: 'We are experiencing technical difficulties - try again later.' 2 stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights - but downgraded on both sectors. [Still not happy that I was involuntarily downgraded on my last BA flight at Easter!] Athens used to have a great BA lounge. Now it's provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grim. Partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight. Flights adequate but no different really to service of any budget airline. Crew apologetic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in BA's direction. Athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people - albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain / claim. BA are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew - without them I'd have already deserted. Still waiting for any response from airline re EU compensation / downgrade almost 2 weeks after submitting forms / emails. This could surely be automatic [managed by most US airlines] and contrasts with a recent Air France experience of far more trivial nature where within 24 hours I'd received a voucher and a personal apology."
740,E Hanner (United Kingdom) 7th August 2017,5/10,"""they are now a junk airline""","✅ Verified Review |  Nice to London Heathrow. I had to fly to Nice and back for work. Booked through the Company travel Agency. Extra bag added both ways. I wanted to fly back to LHR earlier so my Travel Agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 GBP. When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flight. I stood my ground, but the Head of Check in told me if I wanted to fly I had to pay 75 EUR which I did under duress. I had prebooked my seat as Silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  The trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means I will not be choosing this airline again. I have one more flight with them next week and that's it. I paid almost 1100 pounds to get to Nice and back today, in economy, I was greeted with disdain by Ground Staff, the Crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who, despite the high prices, have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic. Aircraft are tired and worn. Toilets stink. Please do yourself a favour and book someone else."

M Robinson (Canada) 3rd August 2017",1/10,"""budget airline service at best""","✅ Verified Review |  Unimpressed! Service very indifferent, impression that it's only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight. Perfunctory service at best! Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. My understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 stars. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offer more beverages. And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. The wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet. On Westjet, you purchase your food, but I'm sure it has to be superior to BA's offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Air France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only redeeming factor on this flight was the Airbus 380, still the smoothest and quietest plane flying! Apparently British Airways CEO is an accountant and the 'bean counting' shows in the service and food quality offered! Service on my flight was budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to Britain's flag carrier!"

Christopher Neep (United Kingdom) 3rd August 2017",3/10,"""declined to level of a budget airline""","✅ Verified Review |  British Aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world, well known for outstanding inflight service, decent food, comfortable seats, good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines. How times have changed! Under recent CEOs, most notably the current holder the post, Alex Cruz, BA has declined to the level of a budget airline. In fact, I've had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. Flying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it's a wonderful aircraft. Beyond that - atrocious. Dinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. Hardly suitable breakfast fare. The entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. No snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every way. It's very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a CEO who's strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airlines."

Apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with Marks & Spencer buy-on-board menu, on that particular flight, they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay. It was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we'll just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices. This came only a month after the major ""IT failure"" that grounded all BA flights for a weekend. The only thing they have left is safety - if they lose that, then it's over."

It took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 (our row) there was no food left not even a Kit-Kat we had the last can of Coca Cola and a bottle of water. Several factors contributed to this silly situation : BA Trying to become a low cost airline (I did not realise that it had sunk so low when I booked). The fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay.  The blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling. BA Trying to keep the front toilet for business class passengers. Totally inadequate  supply of food on board the aircraft, this meant the sales person had to go through what was left with every sale in the hope of finding something that the passenger would accept."

Problems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. From various conversations that took place, it would appear that there were no British Airways staff at Venice Marco Polo airport; everything is handled by the local service agents. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties.  Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge, the departure board information did not help. After arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away, arriving at 24:00. The following day, on the replacement flight, we were taxiing out and a flight-deck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed. I am all for safe flying but BA need to improve their standards."

751,Alan Wan (United Kingdom) 25th July 2017,2/10,"""can't really complain about the overall experience""","✅ Verified Review |  This was a one way Avios redemption flight. Fare cost £17.50 and 7,500 Avios each. As a BA Gold member I used the First class wing at T5, this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. We were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. The lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. The buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilli. My wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was bland. The drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although I don't drink the stuff the choice looked extensive. I had a few glasses of Henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful Castlenau they used to have but not as good as the Taittinger they served a year ago. I tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can't remember what it was called but it was very nice. Finally I couldn't resist a shot of Johnnie Walker Blue. The first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. I normally try to fly another Oneworld airline other than BA. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA Gatwick First lounge than the Galleries T5. The flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on time. I didn't bother with the BoB as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in Bologna. Cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the BoB offering. We sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3L. Really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight. Due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the last passengers to exit. It was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage. Despite a lot of moans about BA on this forum I can't really complain about the overall experience. As a Gold member the lounge access was free. But if I paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes I'd be disappointed."

The rest was disappointing. The outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing, you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule. There was no apology. The return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain. There was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an 18g chocolate bar. It felt like being in school. Cabin crew weren't overly friendly on either journey. Inflight entertainment was fine, lots of films both new and old to watch. We would usually fly Emirates or Virgin but decided to fly BA to give it a go. If you have similar thoughts, don't do it. We won't be flying with BA again, they are not worth it. It is very British - elitist and inefficient."

Another of my party did want to check in her hand baggage and was told no. Both times the ground staff were inconsitant, rude and uncooperative .I was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat. The new seat configuration is so narrow now I could not get into the allocated seat as I have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get to the seat. Fortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat. I put a small plastic bag with fragile items in the overhead locker, the steward, without telling me or consulting me, moved it. When I queried this I was told ""Madam,  I know what I am doing I have done this before"". I am 71 years old and I refuse to be so patronised so I was ready for a stand up row by this time. Fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation. No food left at the back of the plane as usual.

BA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. The good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful. The bad: A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer (BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate!) - even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus.

756,M Keane (United Kingdom) 22nd July 2017,5/10,"""endured rather than enjoyed""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Brussels return. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in the days of BOAC and BEA). Having said that the flights to and from Brussels were OK in a full aircraft either way."

Meares (United Kingdom) 21st July 2017",3/10,"""very poor quality seats""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats. The cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in BA's club class. Still no wi-fi on BA? Even discount carriers like Norwegian have this now, let along the flag carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways."

I was sat in Row 21, probably 3/4 of the way back. It was an evening weekday flight,so everyone tired & hungry. Their new M&S service was a disaster. The flight was just over 2 hours. It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. By the time it arrived all that was available was a KitKat and some other sweets! They had already run out of sandwiches / hot food. It took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card - and the machine seemed to keep on having problems. Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored). Have to say this services is no better than Easyjet & I will think twice about travelling with BA. If it wasn't paid for by work I would not have travelled with them. The service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier."

We had a delay in take off but apologies provided. Food was okay and I was pleasantly surprised. Crew members were hard working, polite and professional. The Boeing 777-200was showing signs of age (G-VIIW ) but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year, this plane appeared more cared for.

Economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food. Regardless of class of travel, the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition. The following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller. I started watching a movie on the flight from Montreal to London but the last 15 min of the movie were missing. It looked like the recording consisted of only the first 105 min (out of 121 min total) of the movie. In the next few days I tried to see the last part of the movie on other two BA flights (business and economy plus) and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing. In addition to this minor problem, all BA flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system: the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise (once again, the same problem applied to all flights)."

Check in at Newcastle rapid without a queue. Fast track worked well. Lounge was ok, but limited selection of food. Onboard all flights, the domestic and European biz class is fine. Seats with decent legroom, choice of food (chicken salad, charcuterie and cheese) and good quality drinks. The staff were lovely, professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectors. Crew from GVA-LHR particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival. All of this during the Mixed Fleet strike dates. T5 South Lounge at LHR was like a sauna, and access impossible from south security (involves a long walk downstairs then up again). North lounge better on return, but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an update. Tagged priority bags were literally the last on the belt at Geneva which was a joke, but likely not BA's fault. First off back in Newcastle. Overall, the short haul business product is perfectly adequate, if for nothing other than skipping queues. BA's lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors, but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job."

S Sigurdursson (Iceland) 9th July 2017",8/10,"""experience has certainly changed""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Keflavik. The British Airways experience has certainly changed. I'm happy to pay less and still be treated like the staff are happy to see me and that's not always the case when flying with low cost airlines. Terminal 5 is one of the best terminals at Heathrow and as we were connecting from a long haul flight from Asia on another carrier we were a bit tired and travel weary when taking this morning flight. But the staff greeted us with a smile, the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable. It's bring your own entertainment and you'll have to purchase both food and drinks. Which we found to be comparatively good value for money and quite good. I like the BA service touch. It manages to be both nice and efficient. We had a nice smooth flight home to Iceland at the end of our vacation and I can honestly say that I'm looking forward to my next flight with BA."
763,J Dallen (United Kingdom) 9th July 2017,8/10,"""really pleasant experience""","✅ Verified Review |  I was a bit nervous when I booked my Bristish Airways return flight from London - Tokyo, but I had a really pleasant experience. The flight attendants were lovely, attentive, prompt and sweet. I'm a nervous flyer so I tend to drink a lot and I never felt judged or like I was bothering them by ordering another. The food was good, plenty of in-flight movie options and the pilot was very reassuring. I'm not really sure what else I could need. Also, the price of the ticket was affordable."
764,K Sawyer (United Kingdom) 8th July 2017,8/10,"""see the decline in quality from BA""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointed to see the decline in quality from BA since I last flew with them. For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. The food was also poor. No snacks offered, and the meals were slop. I have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comfort. Good points: the cabin crew were reasonably good, toilets were clean, and the in-flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection, but that wasn't enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience."
765,John Keeler (Spain) 7th July 2017,4/10,"""declined due to cost cutting""","✅ Verified Review |  Boston to Barcelona via London. I am a silver BA card holder and reserved two flights (myself and my wife) from Boston to London Heathrow (in premium economy) and Heathrow to Barcelona in Economy class. I paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved (in the exit row), due to a change of aircraft configuration. Although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number. To date there has been no communication or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. Overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. We will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year. In an article about British Airways in the Financial Times on 2nd June it said that their customers are less and less happy, but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy. Eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important."
766,E Smyth (United Kingdom) 6th July 2017,5/10,"""pre-selected seats retained""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Mauritius in business class. The check in and lounge were of a reasonable standard and the new lounge at Gatwick is nice. Boarding was fine and pre-selected seats retained. The layout and features were standard of club world and service of the level expected. The club kitchen was fairly limited in its offerings. Half the entertainment did not work properly if at all. In short acceptable service. Flight left and arrived on time. However, BA should take note that for this route, Emirates were less expensive and would have offered an A380 offering on both legs. The reason for choosing BA was the fact it was a direct service."
767,Neil Baines (United Kingdom) 6th July 2017,6/10,"""turn it into a budget airline""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Larnaca. British Airways was once the flagship airline of the UK, you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest. Now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches - they even charge for water and if you don't have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they don't take cash. I did not mind paying that bit extra for BA flights but now better off with EasyJet."
768,S Garton (United Kingdom) 5th July 2017,2/10,"""recommend to avoid flying with BA""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Hong Kong in premium economy. I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness. I will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with BA."
769,John Wallace (United Kingdom) 5th July 2017,2/10,"""serious need of a makeover""","✅ Verified Review |  Belfast to Munich via Heathrow. Today (4th July) I found I needed to change a travel date from 7th July to 6th July.  I attempted to do this on BA's ""Manage My Booking"" for about 2 hours and, although I selected 4 different flight times, each time I thought my booking change was completed (at an extra cost of £156-199 + seat costs), I was told that my changed flights were fully booked, even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available (quite a few). So. I contacted BA's Customer Services by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who, after saying hello and providing his name, promptly lost me. So, another 20 minutes later, I spoke to another (very caring and helpful) BA agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost +£500 onto my £218 ticket! I could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less! I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help. BA - you are in serious need of a makeover and self-examination to have customers, such as I, consider using you again and not tell everyone to avoid you and write reviews such as this."
770,Timothy Farr (United Kingdom) 30th June 2017,5/10,"""attentive and good natured""","✅ Verified Review |  Just landed from the second of two flights in First between London and Kuala Lumpur and on both legs, the experience was exceptional. Chose seats 1E and 1F on both legs for my partner and I, and seats were clean, well maintained, fully functioning and very comfortable. Ground service at T5 is a vast improvement with the new First Wing; passed through quickly and met by attentive staff, with prompt and professional service in the Concorde Room. Golden Lounge at Kuala Lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu. Onboard the staff on both legs were professional, friendly, intuitive, attentive and good natured, and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests. Flowers in the bathroom (which was kept clean, though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times) and amuse bouche provided. Plenty of wine, no shortage of food and nothing ran out - my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask. These flights reminded of why we fly with BA and remain loyal to them."

B Samson (Ghana) 30th June 2017",2/10,"""Club World is now very tired and worn""","✅ Verified Review | British Airways business class Heathrow to Accra as the BBC reported ""The most delay-afflicted route. 85 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer"". As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delays. Indeed my flight the delay was, as usual, over an hour. The Club World product is now very tired and worn - no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers. The BA crew were fine, but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. Usual chaotic boarding process for this flight - the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage, but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. It will never work on this routing. When will BA learn? The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, American or Royal Jordanian. The constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service. The comfort is now more akin to Ethiopian Airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of BA. The LHR-ACC-LHR route is a money maker for BA - they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth. Air France and KLM probably offer a better business class service on this route. A great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard."

I haven’t even taken this flight yet and I am totally disillusioned. I have flown with British Airways 3 times out of Manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my long haul connecting flight. On this occasion I have decided to drive down to London Heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike! I telephoned BA customer service today to ask about the laptop situation, after pressing many buttons I was informed all the lines are busy and cut off. I will never book a flight with BA again, even if this means I have a long layover or connection time. This airline is a national disgrace and the British flag should be removed from the livery. If I get on the flight, I will let you know how it is!"
774,R Jarvis (United Kingdom) 29th June 2017,1/10,"""they are failing dismally""","✅ Verified Review |  On the 13th June 2017 I travelled from Mykonos to London Heathrow on BA 651. If British airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally. We were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase. All we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits. This flight left around lunchtime and I would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. To add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. It was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting.  'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore. Easy jet, Ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles. I cannot imagine flying with BA again."
775,G Stratton (United Kingdom) 29th June 2017,1/10,"""I will no longer pick BA""","✅ Verified Review |  I was flying back from Zurich to Heathrow after a visit to see my son. We arrived in time at the airport. Check in was quick and friendly. But once we got through security the trauma of BA began. A 2 hour delay on the screen. Why didn't they tell us at check-in? Yes, they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. Once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet. No welcome. The seats were hard and uncomfortable. Before taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door. The door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty. A strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying! When the food service came I was asleep but my said they ignored her. When we did arrive at Heathrow T5 we ended up at the C gates, so adding another 20 minutes or so. Based on this I will no longer pick BA as a preference. The brand once the favourite airline is no longer."
776,Edward Smith (United Kingdom) 28th June 2017,2/10,"""BA has lost the plot""","✅ Verified Review |  Rome to Heathrow flight on the 23rd June delayed take off over 6 hours due to technical fault. Minimal information and absolutely no customer service or support. No refreshments provided. The only information we received was when the captain came of the aircraft to tell us what was happening, he was the only one who cared. BA support and service in Rome was non existent. After take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably I had to pay £2.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided. BA is now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus, actually thats unfair to budget airlines who provide much better service. BA has lost the plot."
777,M Hart (United Kingdom) 27th June 2017,1/10,"""BA are going backwards""","✅ Verified Review |  Chennai to London. What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timing. But I have nothing good to say about the whole thing. The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. Once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and if you're in the Aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by Boeing. It was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter of BA and I'm so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customer. Sorry BA but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money, because it won't last, people like me will move on."

R Young (Australia) 27th June 2017",3/10,"""Leg room was atrocious""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Gatwick to Genoa with British Airways. Fast check in at the smart new premium area at Gatwick. Brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food, drink and magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal I realize that nothing can be done about that. The gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace, especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators. On board our Club Europe seats that we had paid extra to choose, something that no other airline that I know of does with a full Business Class fare, was behind the curtain. Overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club Europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance. An engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3. My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. Given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport. In all this was not a Business Class quality flight, we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price."

B Saunders (Ghana) 27th June 2017",4/10,"""now providing a very inferior product""","✅ Verified Review |  
Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely. Shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels."
780,Mike Palmer (Canada) 19th June 2017,5/10,"""whether I continue my loyalty""","✅ Verified Review |  This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed Fleet"". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken curry was served but I still don't see it as Biz class food. A choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. The jury remains out on whether I continue my loyalty to BA and One World - it really depends on what BA do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - I'm off)."

B Stauffer (South Africa) 17th June 2017",1/10,"""crews very young, unprofessional""","✅ Verified Review | The crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from Johannesburg to London were very young, unprofessional, and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the British Airways crews special and outstanding. They were basically (on both flights) rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service. On both flights, there was no water offered during the night, which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium. The meals were overcooked, and on both flights the knives could not cut through the ""best of British Beef"". Given that the hot meals are the same than in Club (according to BA's marketing), I would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in Business Class. A perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when I got up after dinner and went to the galley (as nobody cared to answer the bell) and asked for a Baileys: the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a Baileys was, and the answer came ""sorry Sir, we don't have that kind of wine. Would you like some white?"" I am missing the good old BA and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future, even if it means paying a few hundreds more."

John Rolfe (United Kingdom) 16th June 2017",2/10,"""Boarding was a disaster""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew Valencia to London Gatwick with British Airways. Check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay. Security was a bit slow (no fast track). Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. Boarding was a disaster, we were called to board but then waited on the air-bridge for over 20 minutes. The air-bridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no AC or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out. Eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy). There was no communication from the ground staff, which although not BA staff reflects badly on the airline. Once we were finally on-board the flight was trouble free. Good service. Hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant. Plane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay. priority baggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control. Would have been a nice trip back bar the problems in Valencia airport."

Craig Cutts (United Kingdom) 16th June 2017",5/10,"""possibly my last BA flights""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, possibly my last BA flights. I used economy (or maybe should be re named) economy minus outbound and returned in Club Europe, checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at T5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future. Bye BA."

BA lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available. Refreshments in the lounge Ok, but nothing special. Boarding on time, cabin crew in Club Europe were very pleasant and efficient as I always find with BA. Meal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight, three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter, Thyme Roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake, washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne.

Dirty aircraft, uncomfortable seats, inflight entertainment is something that would have existed in the 80s, has been the same for several years. no meal choice (meat). either one meat or veg. half empty cabin across the entire flight, ran out of alcohol too. BA have and are continuing to cost cut, but they haven't cut their prices to reflect this. I would seriously fly someone else. Enough is enough, you've had my 15 years of loyalty silver exec club member or not, I'm off - and will advise others to do the same. I cannot give a 0 out of 10, the 1 is purely for the cabin crew who are embarrassed by what is now Budget Airways."
788,John Drennan (United Kingdom) 13th June 2017,1/10,"""third world experience""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Madrid. An absolute third world experience once I got on the plane. Check-in and lounge experience were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and 'Do Not Occupy' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley, and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering, and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button. The one and only reason I booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing I'd bought."
789,Jay Gallup (United Kingdom) 13th June 2017,3/10,"""the same price as normal""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Alicante. My wife, my son (4) and me all flew BA Euro Club on our way to Alicante, for some reason when booking Club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer. My son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before. The staff at BA were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch. Club Euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra, the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane, its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it would be nice to have slightly more legroom"
790,T Palmer (United Kingdom) 9th June 2017,5/10,"""BA now gone to the dogs""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Dubai. Good crew, everything else terrible. Caught up in the shambles of BA IT system collapse on 27th May so very lucky to get tickets on flight next day. BA staff hung out to dry by appalling senior management. Flight itself next day, crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty IFE. Food ok, seat comfy but had seen better days and needed re-upholstering. Was told luggage would be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of Heathrow from the day before, luggage finally turned up Wednesday - 4 days late. Compensation claim into BA rather a lot - hopefully all gets paid. BA have had a number of IT failures past 12 months, simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers ((Emirates on this route) for a couple of years until I know BA has resolved its reliability problems and the product offering is more competitive. Shame really, BA used to stand for something and its now gone to the dogs."

Neil Solomons (Canada) 8th June 2017",1/10,"""one of the worst airlines""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Vancouver. I am very disappointed by BA's gradual decline. Today I flew in the upper deck of the A380. BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think that's a poor ratio. The flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. The beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recently. This is a great shame. The cabin is bad, the food is awful, the flight attendants unpleasant and IFE OK."
792,M Simpson (United Kingdom) 8th June 2017,3/10,"""Overall not recommended""","✅ Verified Review |  I took a long daytime flight from Tokyo to London (about 12 hours). The Boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean, and the Premium Economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight, with good recline, although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space. The catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any). By the time we landed I was hungry and thirsty, and I would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. The crew were invisible for most of the flight. The IFE system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines. Overall not recommended."
793,A Evans (United Kingdom) 8th June 2017,3/10,"""have become a long haul Ryanair""","✅ Verified Review | British Airways were truly awful on this flight from Heathrow to Miami. Very old tired aircraft. These old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit. Seat back screens unbelievably small. What shocked me most is just how much BA have cut back on their food service. No bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore. Dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option. The chicken breast I received was laughable. I have seen bigger chicken nuggets. This came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. The only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule scone. My advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry. Staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley. Unfortunately BA have now become a long haul Ryanair, scrimping on every little thing. Not good."
794,Kathleen Kirby (United Kingdom) 8th June 2017,1/10,"""crew on both flights friendly and efficient""","✅ Verified Review | We flew out of terminal 5 on Saturday with British Airways to Brussels, and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly, we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures. We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them. We used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was good. On the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn't fancy the Marks and Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our gate, and thought that was expensive enough, but the BA on board water was £1.80 per bottle. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. On our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure. At all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up. This delay was not BA s fault, and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the flight but hope that BA do not make any further cuts, and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day."
795,A Marham (United Kingdom) 7th June 2017,9/10,"""from bad to worse""","✅ Verified Review | British Airways seems to be going from bad to worse. On my London Heathrow to Lisbon flight, the card machine didn't accept American credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldn't pay for his drink. The length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren't offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing. The flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for BA. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline. They are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices."
796,Lucye Deacon (United Kingdom) 7th June 2017,1/10,"""BA is going to the dogs""","✅ Verified Review |  Booked Gatwick to Lima return. Out World Traveller+ (premium economy) which was not too bad. Return Club World was appalling! Seats and surround grubby. Equipment maintenance poor. Service was appalling. Staff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wanted. Expected us to know how to operate equipment. Food thrust at us not served! Everything rushed. No politeness in service. Drink choice not outlined just 'what do you want. If it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of money. It is so sad that BA is going to the dogs, a business is nothing without customers and BA are doing a great job at alienating them. I will not fly BA long haul again."
797,W Leeson (United Kingdom) 7th June 2017,3/10,"""service on BA really is terrible""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Johannesburg. After getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend IT fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by BA, I approached my flight back to the UK with some trepidation. My fears were not unfounded. As the aircraft had been sitting at JNB for most of the day, there were no delays and boarding started very early. I was seat 83A (top deck, double seat) and the leg room was no better than you would find on a Ryanair flight to Dublin. Indeed, due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat, it was a little more cramped. The service on BA flights really is terrible. I, along with many other passengers, was treated like an inconvenience and I felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren't there. I was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff. I will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
798,Vincent Borlaug (United States) 7th June 2017,1/10,"""I'm sticking with them""","✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Sofia via London, flying World Traveller Plus premium economy to London and EuroTraveller economy on the short hop. Top quality service, whatever may have declined in economy class, premium economy is as good as ever with 38in leg-room and meals (really tasty in this instance) that can be ordered in advance. The cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabin. Smooth connections at Terminal 5 with no waiting (either way) and Tribute Cornish Ale available on the long haul drinks menu, and service is a winner. (I'll admit the M&S food/drink service can be a bit time-consuming as far as handling the payments, but works OK otherwise.) British Airways continue to deliver a first-rate travel experience, and I'm sticking with them."
799,J Rose (United Kingdom) 6th June 2017,10/10,"""are not a 4 star airline""","✅ Verified Review |  Edinburgh to Rome via Heathrow. I have been either BA Gold or Silver for many years , the last 2 years I was in Texas but ensured my return to UK that flights were always BA and the same for my family who visited. in July 2016 I returned to UK for business and had to stay until Jul 12th, I was 3 points off retaining get Gold if I had flown back on 11 July I would have retained Gold. I had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem, however I was duly downgraded to Silver. I then booked a holiday in Rome for my wife and myself and I was amazed that BA have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea ! If BA wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine. They have in the past left me stranded in Moscow for 5 days when snow closed Heathrow, yet BMI were still flying into Heathrow, I have encountered rude staff on check in, long queues even for Executive members. They are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status, I will in future fly Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa or Internal UK Easyjet. They are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let get poor reviews. If BA wish to be a budget airline then start charging like one"

Only tap water available, everything else needs credit card. American family with hungry young boys couldn't buy anything for them as their machine wouldn't take US card. Return flight cancelled after 4 hours on tarmac with the IT crash. Staff brilliant, including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he could. Then BA ticket desk unmanned in Geneva airport, so queues just standing. We were lucky to find swissair flight home or I think we'd still be there!"
801,R Warren (United Kingdom) 29th May 2017,2/10,"""business class is very cramped""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There's really no comparison to Emirates' long-haul offering in Business."

We then learnt from the steward that it's a new configuration that hasn't gone down very well with customers. This once great airline that's gone from the best to the worst in 5 years, and on European routes it's no more than a budget carrier, money is the key driver for BA with customers very last on the list. We all felt we had paid for a service we never received."
803,L Denham (United Kingdom) 29th May 2017,5/10,"""cost cutting may back fire""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bilbao. I fly British Airways a fair amount mainly for pleasure. But recently they are beginning to slip. My last flight was with two friends for our annual outing, this year to Bilbao. Cannot fault the staff or flight crew. However, the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid. There is now no reason to use BA for short haul when there is a low cost alternative. This cost cutting may well back fire. Probably initiated by the same imbeciles who caused the computer outsourcing problems recently."
804,S Cartey (United Kingdom) 29th May 2017,2/10,"""very disappointing experience """,✅ Verified Review |  Madeira to London. I was always of the belief that British Airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but I realise now that they are no better than budget airlines. In fact I have experienced far better service on EasyJet. We waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and I ordered Marks & Spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours. On top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. Of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took! They make it very clear that 'economy' class is just that but its shame the price doesn't match the standard of service. All in all a very disappointing experience and I will certainly think twice about choosing BA in future.

This was my first time flying with BA and probably my last if I have other option. It didn't feel like a national carrier, felt more like budget airline with no snacks/drinks and fare class that doesn't include checked baggage. Flight was smooth enough, efficient but boarded 15mins late in Edinburgh. No service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee."
806,T Lameera (United States) 27th May 2017,6/10,"""abandoned us at Rome airport""","✅ Verified Review |  Rome to London. Thursday May 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730. This caused missed connecting flight to Los Angeles. Very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants. No one took charge of our situation, information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. No one from BA was seen or heard from at hotel. Multiple calls by passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistance. Friday, May 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counter. After 1 hour in line I obtain a boarding pass on a flight to London with connection to Los Angeles, however the BA desk attendant informs me that the flight out of Rome is late due to technical issues and I will once again miss the flight out to LA. I'm appalled at the lack of educated, experienced BA assistance! BA abandoned us at Rome airport. In addition there web site is of no help. Flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact."
807,M Sissel (Ireland) 24th May 2017,1/10,"""little to no service""",✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to London. Very different from the flight over. It's all about the crew and how they perform or how serious they take their job. One crew was rude and when asked could I have a glass of water told me that it would take a long time and he disapeared down the back to chat to his fellow workers.  The food was slapped up and we were not offered another drink. All male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the back and ignored when called. It's a shame when you see BA trying to turn around and survive and then you have lazy rude staff giving little to no service to the customers or the airline.

809,S Roper (United Kingdom) 23rd May 2017,9/10,"""overall truly awful experience""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Miami. I was looking forward to this flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck used to be such a treat! I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent. These days I would choose AA (or Delta, United, Virgin) any day over BA. It was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience."

Flight good, cabin crew pleasant, food OK-ish, though nothing special. Back on a 777, more comfortable and quieter than 787, though still nowhere near A380 standards. Crew excellent, food unexpectedly good (the veggie lasagne was one of the best I've ever had), and the wine of a good quality. Luggage appeared promptly at both ends. Overall a good experience."

M Darssen (Mexico) 13th May 2017",8/10,"""I have given up on avios""",✅ Verified Review |  Mexico City to Copenhagen via London. It appears inflight service has improved a bit in Club and the food is now edible and available. In flight entertainment reminds one of the VHS days. Number of films available is rather limited. Timing with food was great. Served quickly after take off and again late before arrival. Made time for a good rest. Configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats. Some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5. Ba refuses to credit Qatar Airways avios even when Qatar Airways in writing has confirmed they should be credited. Showing one level on my online profile right now and anotheron my ticket. I have given up on avios.

Ivan Oscar Sterza (Italy) 13th May 2017",6/10,"""not improving where they should""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Santiago de Chile. Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the B787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any B777 I've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the ""cocoon"" look less cramped). Even the seat looks wider, while the IFE screen is wider with a higher resolution. The odd ""ying-yang"" layout is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won't share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes though. The crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. Overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth EUR3,000 spent. Still no wi-fi on BA. Not commenting the ying-yang layout, which remains a mystery to me (who approved such a nonsense?)."

As a regular flyer with BA, my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image. Beyond that, they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry. They have no solution for the slightest problem! We were scheduled to fly to Amsterdam on the 1st of Feb at 07.45, there was a radar problem in Amsterdam. Easyjet etc were informing their customers of development, nobody informed anyone at the BA desk until it became a confusion at almost 09.30! We were rescheduled to the 11.40 flight with another further 2 hours delay. Before this I have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the 11.40 flight. I now had two sets of ticket for same flight. Up to now, getting a refund is a nightmare!"

The check-in was smooth which encouraged me that I had made the right choice. However on-board the ageing Boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about, the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than I have previously had with BA. The space available was tight for me; an average sized man - I don't know how a larger and or taller person would manage. BA has lost two loyal customers, but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remain. On my next long-haul I will regretfully opt for an alternative airline."

The crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her 2-year old, and I asked the crew to ""help"" with the situation, they told me that it's the passenger's right to do whatever they want. So no common sense there. Despite having other seats available in the business area, they refused to move me, even though they were seeing the issue (I couldn't fit in my seat for a 10 hour flight). They even told us off as they were getting aggravated by us being nosy! I had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats! Needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is 0/5 stars. This is not the BA that people once knew. It's under IAG and new ""leadership"" team that aim to cut expenses at any cost, one of them being customer service. Avoid like the plague!"

My 'randomly' allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights, seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats. I'm not too bothered about the lack of drinks / meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles - no cash payment option, not enough stock etc etc. On arrival back at Heathrow T5, we were parked on a remote stand by T3 and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal. The staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low BA had sunk, how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape! Save your cash and go with a genuine budget airline would be my advice."

Instead they only refunded the taxes/insurance etc. for the cancelled booking. I called BA at the beginning of March to find out what had happened, They told me that they would get back to me within 30 days. Two months later I called them again and was told that the refund department would call me. This they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they would not pay me back. Either the executive club of BA are lying or they are incompetent. I was asked the time and date when I called BA but unfortunately I do not have it because I did not think it necessary to log the call. It is obvious to me that BA do not honour their commitments and I will no longer fly with them. I have been an executive member for 40 years and this is how BA treat their customers. An absolute disgrace."

Rude and aggressive customer service department. Both BA flights in the morning/midday and the only flights to Heathrow were delayed by up to 3 hours. No clear sign on boarding gate screen of delayed flights and big mess up of mixing the delayed flights on the screen. Resulting in being stranded in Rome airport with BA customer service not willing to take any responsibility for their mess up and no compensation or even refund, let alone minimum of trying to help a client."

J Pang (United Kingdom) 3rd May 2017",2/10,"""is simply a budget airline""","✅ Verified Review |  Keflavik to London Heathrow. This time I was among the first few passengers aboard the aircraft. I was travelling with two companions so I had to find the space for 3 trolley cases. I discovered a suitcase was already in the overhead compartment above my seat, and it belonged to a cabin crew. . It was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers, and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process? BA on short haul is simply a budget airline, and worse than their competitors in the hand baggage management. I wasn't impressed by their on board service either. They were so greedy to earn money from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers, even though they were complaint by other passengers."
823,Andrew Macleod (United Kingdom) 3rd May 2017,1/10,"""a poor service all round ""","✅ Verified Review |  Glasgow to Chicago via Heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to Premium economy at an extra cost. What a disappointment, the aircraft was an old 747-400 badly in need of a refit. Cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work. This took until 40 minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight. Staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy. In fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight BA 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg. To be honest BA had a cheek to charge for this supposed 'premium product' This was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on Virgin. To make matters worse the BA customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort. With no regards for keeping future business. To be honest a poor service all round from our national carrier"

With BA and being a Gold (Emerald) member I have lost my patience. I have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade. Whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error, it has been 7 days of this. I have contacted BA through their twitter account to be told to call their Bahrain call centre, which of course does not work but have been told to call the Indian centre. 4 times I have called at my own expense to get people with poor English, have no idea how to manage the upgrade, quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price. Social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some one take control. It has got to the point like so many other reviews I will use the avios and move to Qatar who appreciate their loyal customers.  My advice the ground as well at the air service is now budget."

Almost hilarious had I not just been handed my debit card back when the plane was advised to put their tray tables back in the upright position. I was in row 12 the first 7 were business class. I was the last to be offered food or a drink. I had the sandwich and wine when I got home. It would have been easier to buy the sandwich (bigger choice at M&S) at Edinburgh airport. The budget airlines could show British Airways how to do a proper operation. The remaining 10 or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink. BA could not even be the acronym for budget airline. Absolutely useless.

In over 30 years of flying I've never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as British Airways has recently. I can accept that I now have to pay extra if I want to check in a bag, but to sit on a 'full-service' airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water, really? Did I miss something, have they lowered their prices? No, they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was (and still is at their prices) included in the fare. BA now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we'd almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger who'd ordered a hot sandwich, but because the payment machine wasn't working, they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without. The atmosphere was pretty grim, it's been a few years since I've experienced such a miserable economy flight. That was probably Ryanair but they've really raised their game. British Airways was a great carrier, even a year or so back, but now it's really overpriced rubbish, and they don't make me feel welcome anymore. There are so many other options in Europe."

Aircraft full but boarding and seating was well handled by the ground staff. The aircraft left 10 mins early, arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule. Within one hour of arrival we were at the gate for our connecting flight to Aberdeen. Service was OK but things are not as they were with British Airways. Food bland and unexciting, drinks service limited. Breakfast was served way to late in the flight. No major complaints, toilets clean and functional. Inflight entertainment worked OK but the volume/ bud type headphones were poor and distorted the dialogue which was hard to follow. Picture was OK. Cabin crew were polite and did their job. Arrival at Terminal 5 C gates and passage to A gates was a breeze at 0600 hrs, walked straight up to Boarder Control, no one else in the line! Even security was very quiet."

Busy flight before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being taken off passengers. Seated in row 12F which was the 6th row of economy class. After taking off on-time, it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows. Service was an absolute shambles! 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class. Instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows, one steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the iPad payment machine. Instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served, the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served (because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows). The senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left! British Airways have really let themselves go downhill - will not be going out of my way to fly with them again unless they're the cheapest option."
829,Tony Spitale (Switzerland) 1st May 2017,1/10,"""pleasant and enjoyable experience""",✅ Verified Review |  Zürich to London Heathrow. As part of a 12-days-trip almost around the world my first leg from Zürich to London was on British Airways. It turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seat. I would have preferred a window-seat though. Boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers. After I settled down I approached her with my request. She said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best. After less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom. So I stayed. The rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too. Special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism. I brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering-service was slow. The new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly. BA should reinstall the old system again. The cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed its age. The flight took off with a delay of 20 minutes but was a the gate at Terminal 5 15 minutes before scheduled arrival time.
830,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 26th April 2017,5/10,"""don't expect much nowadays from BA""","✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Pisa. I fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the South Terminal. Its not as ""user friendly"" as the North - and meanders around, up and down - all over the place. Could also do with a refurbishment. We approached the new BA lounge, which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the Terminal, with reservations as everything BA does nowadays is cheap and skimpy. Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and plenty of booze. Nice and airy with spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. All good so far. Then the flight was called and our new found love affair with BA quickly receded. The walk to the gate was miles, it took us 15 minutes - and needed a bit of a run as well. Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Plane old and dirty. The WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect. Took off on time. My wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tasteless. I settled for a couple of Gin and Tonics. You don't expect much nowadays from BA and therefore you are disappointed - before you get a chance to be disappointed. Crew were fine - and don't like the BA cost cuts. As one said ""we spend half the flight apologising to passengers."" They also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon. I did notice during boarding two passengers bringing their own food and drink on board. Disgraceful."
831,S Dawson (United Kingdom) 26th April 2017,3/10,"""national carrier turned into the worst""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Phoenix. I have been flying with British Airways for years, although I haven't used them recently. I was surprised at the service or lack of service. Our national carrier has turned into the worst. The crew are nce and friendly, so no real complaints apart from on a 10.5 hour flight during the day, they were nowhere to be seen until about 1.5 hours before landing. The food was absolutely appalling. For dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian. I had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless.The chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purée, this was the only thing edible on the plate. A tiny beetroot salad. The obligatory hard as rock bread roll. For dessert, a small piece of chocolate brownie.Complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didn't realise they could ask for wine etc. A small container of water was on the tray.This meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. At which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box, a packet of crisp and popcorn (all carbohydrates) and a small container of water. I tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.Then tea/coffee was served.  I am not expecting a gourmet meal, but there was no thought given to the food provided on British Airways. There was no fruit, no salad, or proper vegetables. There were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. The flight entertainment did not exist. A couple of new films, the rest were old or unheard of. The music/radio (audio) was the same with no new music or unheard of artists. My daughter, booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the US. I have asked her not to book me on British Airways again. I would rather travel on Virgin or Delta indirect. This by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly I just couldn't wait to get off."

We had already flown BA10 from Bangkok to London a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route. Of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked J and K seats. Check in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn't even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn't it fixed prior to the flight?). For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet! Not good enough. Food and wine were OK and crew were good. Flat bed was good. Disembarking was slow. Same movies as BA10 four weeks earlier."
834,S Dawkins (United Kingdom) 24th April 2017,7/10,"""I prepared myself for the worst""","✅ Verified Review | Singapore to London Heathrow - after reading the negative reviews and the press about BA of late, I was not expecting much at all from this trip. Terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. We secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. Seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. BA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgement. Once we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn't expect any either, they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. We got more food and snacks on our Qantas flight from Singapore to Australia, which was much shorter at 7 hours. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, as I prepared myself for the worst. I would only fly them again if I can score cheap seats."
835,S Dewhurst (United Kingdom) 24th April 2017,5/10,"""rapidly becoming a budget airline""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Stockholm Arlanda. BA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. I'm a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly BA, primarily to maintain it. Not any more. It's not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakes. The small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc. have gone too. And I'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6 weeks ahead. It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore. The last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedible. Just about to book with another airline on principle. I have to say I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave. If you're going to be a low cost airline, charge low cost prices."
836,S Lennon (United Kingdom) 24th April 2017,2/10,"""told snacks had been withdrawn""","✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. The flight was packed full. The inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. I have noticed that BA don't seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009 flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. I managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. I have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry with little humidity. I do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestion. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. I complained to BA and also emailed CEO Alex Cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. I was advised that the lack of IFE would be investigated by their maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn't expect them to. By way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. The only way to check is to fly that route again with BA, do I risk it ? Therefore I will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change!"

I am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one. It hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and British airways except the ticket price. My disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins. I haven't flown British Airways for years and I shocked by how much it had gone downhill. It is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers!

838,G Leader (United Kingdom) 23rd April 2017,1/10,"""something has gone terribly wrong""","✅ Verified Review |  Belfast to Seoul via London Heathrow. Pretty poor. Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was ok, nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name. Friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. Flew the same route with Qatar Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. I am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit, like most people. I recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop."

I cannot believe what is happening to BA. The attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product. Cramped seats, chaotic boarding, every flight announced ""our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags"". In other words, they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage. Now you pay for food and even water. Two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. How can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. It is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service - a shame to be called British. This airline is in terminal decline and I need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline. Don't pay for BA shortfall, use cheap alternatives, its the same service."

This is a salute to the fantastic staff at Terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost, because of American Airlines terrible customer service. The trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with BA booking under AA flights from LHR to LAS via JFK. The trip took place on April 3rd 2017 We risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at LHR, because of AA somehow ""magically"" losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping, rather blaming everyone else. The BA service personnel spent hours trying to solve it, and  decided to take matters in their own hands. They got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from LHR to LAS the day after, arranging for accommodation, transport to/from the airport and Dinner / Breakfast, even though AA was mainly responsible for our journey. The service on-board was to expect from a economy flight of that duration. Seats was good, food all right, complimentary drinks and very welcome. The IFE was great, the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircraft's for this type of long haul, but no particular issues."

On the way to Moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. The food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and there were only two for a fully booked economy class). On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that I literally could not even cross my legs, as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. Seats were not reclining either. The food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight. Do not fly BA to Russia. It employs tactics of EasyJet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service."

Andreas Simonsen (Mexico) 18th April 2017",1/10,"""service is polite""",✅ Verified Review |  Copenhagen to Mexico City via London Heathrow. Upper deck window seat. British Airways uses a 2-4-2 configuration with every second seat backwards. To serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat. It also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you. This could be great or horrible. Food is nothing special but service is polite. Bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next day. I had to pick them up myself. Would fly again as usually have good fares to Mexico.

Booked and paid for an aisle seat, but no legroom and narrow seat. Did not eat on the aircraft. Landed on time. Return flight left Rome late, again full. This time I booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit - more leg room. Food on the plane was from M&S. Chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue. The food bore little resemblance to the photograph - dry and not filled. I feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food, receive payment (you can't use cash) and then clear it all up. Passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served. British Airways European flights are nothing more than a no-frills airline. So much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service. This is not good enough."

BA is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare. Check-in is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed, such as gold members, bronze members, families, business class, silver members. They do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then it's a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane. Seating is fair, though leg room is tight. The flight left a little late but arrived almost on time, which was fine. There is no food, nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail's pace with a trolley. I can't believe BA now make passengers pay extra for food and drink. BA shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past. I wonder what has happened to BA for it to have fallen so far? This will be my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available as BA is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore."
846,R Moody (United Kingdom) 18th April 2017,1/10,"""I am ever increasingly disappointed""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Istanbul. I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class."

Unlike some American carriers and some other European carriers, there is no beverage service on short haul flights. Tea costs 2.30 pounds.  Economy overseas is a joke too, they bring the premium drinks/service from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had. They replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options (cookies, snack-sized kit kats and snack-sized mars), you may only have one. I asked to have an extra snack, I was told no, only one. Onboard media is decent, but nothing to write home about. I classify this airline as slightly above a budget airline (you do get one meal after all and entertainment) but not much better than that."
848,A Stewart (United Kingdom) 17th April 2017,2/10,"""I won't be flying BA anymore""","✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I have to agree with all the other reviews on here. BA have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling. There's just nothing positive left to say about them. From the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats, to the disgusting cheap meals. The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. All this would be fine but British Airways still charges premium prices and for what? I just took a flight on the same route with Virgin Atlantic and what a difference! All the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper. I'm afraid to say I won't be flying BA anymore unless it's to use up avios I'd acquired!"
849,Ed Postal (United States) 17th April 2017,1/10,"""charged me for a bottle of water""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Milan Linate. I landed in London after taking connecting flights from Orange County California to Dallas and then Dallas to London both on American. I landed in London at 1:15 P.M. This flight did not leave until 6:30 P.M. I went to the British Airways help desk and asked if I could get on the 3:00 flight. They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. They were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane. I decided to carry it on to the plane. It fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight (there were other bags that were bigger than mine. They actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold. If that wasn't annoying enough, I could not believe I asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water. They also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea. I could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was British Airways. To end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the process. I am a travel agent and will never book for someone else or myself unless there is no other viable choice."

F Jenkins (United Kingdom) 11th April 2017",5/10,"""BA need to invest in a new fleet""","✅ Verified Review |  Well where do you start. This is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand. The ticket price was in excess of £5000. The lounges at LHR T5 need work. Yes British Airways are investing but long overdue. The small lounge for B gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrapped. The seats remain tired. The vanity screen was not working properly. The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew. Change the catering and get a few more choices. Upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an Olympic pole vaulter."

D Stewart (United Kingdom) 10th April 2017",1/10,"""nothing redeeming about BA""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Singapore. Business class flight from Heathrow to Singapore. Flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why, and we were not kept informed. It seems BA is these days later in taking off. During the flight I felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class, and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset. The main meal we were served was absolutely awful. It was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just like gunge, and was not edible. I really don't know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. Also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed - which seemed totally unnecessary. As I was hungry between courses I went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor, and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason. I have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years. I have been a BA silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew. I always try and fly Qatar where possible when going to Asia now, as the service is better and often the price too. There is nothing redeeming about BA."

For the second time travelling this airline our luggage has been lost. Two years ago London to Dublin our bags were lost for two days. So this flight our bags are left in London again! Now I'm stuck in Dubai in winter clothes, missing the pools and beaches at our resort waiting for our bags to turn up. It's only been 3 days now in the same clothes. Upside - service on board BA559 was excellent. However, business class on BA Europe flight is no different to economy so don't pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat."
853,Adrian Beck (United Kingdom) 9th April 2017,4/10,"""legroom is an absolute joke""","✅ Verified Review |  Just got off the flight from Heathrow to New Orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights I have ever had to endure. The legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight - first time I have ever been unable to open my laptop to work (I now understand why they don't offer wifi on board!). The seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say, then it is a dreadful experience. In my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight. I have travelled a lot over the years, first, business and economy, and had a gold British Airways card, but this was just terrible and I don't really know what BA hope to achieve in the long run - I can guarantee, I will seek other airlines first before considering them again. Anybody contemplating going to New Orleans from Heathrow - fly with somebody else and get an internal connection - you won't regret it. As for BA, they have about as much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul as Trump has of winning the Nobel prize for oratory, were it to exist!"
854,Kathleen Kirby (United Kingdom) 9th April 2017,1/10,"""being turned into Vueling""","✅ Verified Review |  We flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience.  We were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour. The lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert. What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usual. The only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre. This all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and we, like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that BA is being turned into Vueling. If it weren't for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on BA who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe, we would not travel on BA. We would try to find another full service airline, because we enjoy flying."
855,C Haines (United Kingdom) 8th April 2017,8/10,"""feel disrespected and undervalued""","✅ Verified Review |  The cabin crew, bar one lazy individual, were excellent. T5 feels like a monopoly - Galleries Lounge food is simply appalling. Between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food. Unused hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. Why not leave it ??? So all you have is bread and stodgy croissants. The upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious clean. Cabin crew friendly, although you can sense lower morale. BA flights are often late now in my experience. The Club World A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite everyone knowing, crossing over someone's legs too get out is still a nuisance. There is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing - I had one bloke shout at me when I'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.  Many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued, let down after years of loyalty and serious spending. We're not getting what we're paying for, although charged. That's the sad bit."
856,R Thomas (Germany) 7th April 2017,3/10,"""turning BA into a low-cost carrier""","✅ Verified Review |  I am just sad to have to write this review. I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to. Meanwhile I understand, that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes. I do hope BA will do so in the hopefully not to distant future - and keep their great staff on ground and on board."
857,O Francis (United Kingdom) 7th April 2017,1/10,"""service inevitably snail-paced""","✅ Verified Review | No, no, no, British Airways. You've messed up. Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. Sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. You're promising things you can't deliver, BA. There is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. Whoever at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways is almost complete. You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""British Airways, the world's least favourite airline""."
858,L Johnson (United Kingdom) 6th April 2017,1/10,"""can no longer live on past reputation""","✅ Verified Review | Having only flown easyJet / Ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, I was pleased to see a relatively low-cost BA flight for my round trip from London to Rome. In hindsight, I wish I'd booked a different airline and not booked BA based on its legacy reputation. To say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. I expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. Narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. Regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. Even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. Lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. I was also tantalised by the BA bragging of M&S supplied food. I am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. It certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. Sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. No sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. I asked what they did have. Their response 'Bottle of water or a Kit Kat'. After asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'They never give us enough food. It's mad. They give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. Needless to say that BA can no longer live on their past reputation. They had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. Sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. I'd say I'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, I won't bother. What a shame."
859,J Egleton (United Kingdom) 6th April 2017,1/10,"""BA is now a no-frills carrier""","❎ Unverified |  London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier. Lower your expectations to this level, and you'll probably have a pleasant flight."
860,P Cleare (United Kingdom) 27th March 2017,5/10,"""has really gone downhill""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Hong Kong. The new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat, but I was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering. For a 13 hour flight in a Premium Economy I would have assumed it would be similar to others offering, meals, mid flight snacks and other bits. I was very wrong. We had a bar service and meal, there was then nothing until breakfast (exactly the same as the Economy offering). This is appalling, British Airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering. I went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft, they completely understood customer frustrations, they just have nothing to give. BA was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with. Not so much anymore. The crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had. For anyone flying BA, bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids."

This will definitely be my last time with British Airways, I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut to. Staff onboard were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to HKG and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline. If you are undecided about choosing BA over another airline, quite simply do not consider BA - you will be very disappointed and feel cheated."

The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn't much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great hunks of chicken and vegetables, just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating. On the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time. Didn't much care for the cereal bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that!"

London Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways domestic economy, check in at T5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries North lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319. I had seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. The footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards BA. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. The management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting ""it's what our passengers asked for"". I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights. Unfortunately British Airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease it's shareholders."
864,Mike Palmer (Canada) 24th March 2017,3/10,"""worst short haul flight ever""","✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off! Hello Star Alliance!"

I booked a return trip for April 2017 from London to Istanbul a few months in advance, they ended up cancelling my 11:00 flight and moving me to the 07:00 flight which would not work for me. After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. On calling yesterday they told me that I had accepted the changes as it was months ago I told her that the other agent suggested that I wait and decide later. This was followed by the fact that I had purchased a cabin bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. Although this was not my fault. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer. I called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty. I have rebooked with Turkish Airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute, they include food, checked bag, drinks and seat selection and sometimes a Boeing 777 on this route."

The BA staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help. I was very excited to fly on the new Dreamliner from London Heathrow to Dubai, but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard. First the IFE felt very old and not clear at all, something you'd expect on non-refurbished B777's. Choice of movies and TV Shows are pretty good so I can't fault BA on that. The seats are nice, the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay. Cabin Crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us, I was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head. The food is okay (Your first meal) its hot and options were good, two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane. However and this is a big however, your second meal we were given a Breakfast Bar, that was disgraceful! How much of a budget are they on now? I thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us Breakfast bars instead, but on the return journey we were given a cookie for Lunch, people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace. I just can't believe how downhill BA has gone. It's incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too, I think they're running out of money. Unfortunately I booked my flights to Marrakech before this expereince, and I promise that would be the last time I fly with BA."

Every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied. They make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area. Seats are narrow, seat cushions are hard, and I had a ""large"" person next to me both trips. I paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible. Food was passable and no more, but there were two meals on the long flight. Cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training - polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights. Both flights on time. These ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been ""revamped"" they looked tired but clean. The alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft.

No priority boarding, all bussed like sardines on the long journey to T3 where the plane was sat. On board, flight early, nice breakfast, good CC. Return, no lounge, no voucher to compensate for no lounge, no priority security, no priority boarding. CC again good on board and an ok lunch. Seats same in business as they are in economy. Business ticket meant skis carried 'free' - which would have cost £70 or so in economy."

I do not normally write reviews but I was so disappointed with the service and flights from BA for a recent 4 night stay in a Dubai with my wife, that I had to make a comment. Some of the staff (not all) were rude and they had run out of food when they came to serve me. Will try and use other airlines in the future wherever possible."
871,Ian Sinclair (Netherlands) 13th March 2017,3/10,"""tired, worn interior""","✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight, no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats, no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class. Onward flight to St Lucia, paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft. Tired, worn interior and the food reflected this too. Outbound crew were helpful and energetic, keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used. Inbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent service. The only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen, left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when I travelled home. 10/10 to British Airways staff in St Lucia for managing this so well. I hope that BA will be renewing its fleet soon, it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made."
872,B Carr (France) 13th March 2017,4/10,"""now charge for food and drink""","✅ Verified Review |  My last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing, they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy. On my most recent trip from London to Toulouse, I booked using my Avios points. I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so, so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights, I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the fares are still much more expensive. In addition, I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking. I had received one missed call with no message during working hours. Having eventually dug out the right customer services number (these were not provided on the email) I tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long I eventually gave up."

British Airways was the worst airline I have ever flown with. Old shabby and dirty plane. Tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when I arrived. The only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me. The seat I then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back (old food stains) and on the belt. No drink served with meal (except water). When I eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left. I had a white wine. When I asked for a second (yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight I was told they had run out of wine also). I had to have orange juice. Awful and rude staff (with exception of one). Worst airline by far I have ever flown with.

Firstly couldn't book myself in online - my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but I couldn't move him, his seat was fixed. So we had to leave mega early so I could sit near him! Luckily got the seat behind him. Food and seats terrible. Tea time snack an insult, 2 small cookies. Breakfast was a muesli bar! I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct, however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in future. I have complained twice re check in, meals and the broken tray table on the return trip, and have been offered 5000 Avios points (£40) that just ties me into flying with them again, especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want to use them! The cutbacks are a cut too far BA. Tip: buy a sandwich in Boots on way out and buy something to eat on way back before you go to the airport!!."

Simon Oakley (United Kingdom) 10th March 2017",3/10,"""experience was a bit shoddy""","❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing."
877,Anastasia Therianou (United Kingdom) 10th March 2017,5/10,"""not worth paying for business""","✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats. I do not feel that it is worth paying for business with British Airways, and then getting all this chaos. It was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me. Finally, my Lagguage that was 'priority' came out last."

P Reece (United Kingdom) 9th March 2017",1/10,"""not a business class product""","✅ Verified Review |  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit. The product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product. Flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions. I asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about. The arrivals lounge is grim - tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small. Overall very poor and I will not fly with them again unless no other options."
879,E Roper (United Kingdom) 9th March 2017,2/10,"""lack of care extremely disappointing""","✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business. I am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline."

She had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip. As for the food menu? The food is so expensive and it's easy to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices. An airline should not represent a country when it's based on profit above it's people. At least Ryanair etc are honest and cheap! British Airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole !"

Sadly British Airways is now a very poor quality budget airline that still thinks it is a top end carrier. The aircraft are generally old, shabby and dirty. The staff are surly and abrupt, the seating cramped and uncomfortable. I am a business travelled and would prefer to fly Club Europe but I am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economy. It is a joke - if the person in front reclines I can't work - so how is this in any way business class."
883,Michael Souter (United States) 28th February 2017,2/10,"""unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby""","✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Seattle via London Heathrow. I don't know why I chose to fly BA - a sense of nostalgia I think. Going to India this time, I decided to go east, via LHR and BA seemed a good idea. I will not do so again. I specifically booked all the flights through BA so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline"" - ""But BA did all the booking!"". Blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually phoned and got the PNR and checked myself in with a boarding pass. Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. When I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. The fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. Essentially despite BA being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. The flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. On the way back - forget it. Firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! When I asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the plane. I was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. The breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever had. The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. I'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I'm not fat. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta and American Airlines internationals are much better. Generally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. I'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. Its not because they are so much cheaper than others. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. What happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago? (the last time I flew BA). Overall - it's sad."

Due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to Heathrow, which I may add both my wife and I checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th March instead of 12th February. We checked in or tried to check in, whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention. We couldn't prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home. The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chance. We had no choice (over a barrel) scarcity value I hear you cry, no. We boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. My wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn't their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves. To cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedible. We will never fly BA again. British Airways - the worlds biggest rip off."

M Gascoigne (United Kingdom) 26th February 2017",1/10,"""experience was wonderful""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers. I couldn't fault my trip out and I am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable."
887,Nicola Beretta (United Kingdom) 25th February 2017,10/10,"""a journey of disappointment""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast. Sorry BA but you are stuck in the 80s and you're slipping further down my list of preferences."
888,Ken Wilkins (United Kingdom) 24th February 2017,2/10,"""dreadful, stressful experience""","✅ Verified Review |  San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great deal of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissive of customer need. On the plus side Business Class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive. BA need to do better though, far better if they are to compete with the good Middle East and Far Eastern airlines."

890,Michael Davies (United Kingdom) 20th February 2017,5/10,"""on a race to the bottom""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points. The payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my future travel options. I live near Manchester Airport and KLM/Air France and Lufthansa are more attractive options."
891,A Galyan (United Kingdom) 20th February 2017,5/10,"""treats customers with such contempt""","✅ Verified Review |  Edinburgh to London City. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn’t as the flight had been oversold. I accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with Flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn’t be authorised so I had to ‘wait’. I then stood around for 10 minutes, being asked to ‘move out of the way’ at one point because I was blocking others. I was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. I was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. None was available nor could be contacted, apparently. I wasn’t allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight “in case” a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. I was told to wait for another 20 minutes. I argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it’s not their problem that other people had checked-in before me. I was treated as a nuisance. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there ‘waiting’ and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. I asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. He explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in, and as the check-in was closing, they could give me the seat now. I informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. I had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customer. I then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally, especially for a domestic flight). As I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. Under their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking. Some would call this cheating. The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient. I rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in."

Sleeping on overnight flights in economy class is an ordeal in itself, bit I was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing - we had just entered French airspace - all cabin lights were put on bright for the breakfast/snack service (following the dinner after take-of in Accra): the more since this service consisted of a cup of tea or coffee (or cold drink) only. Not even a biscuit was offered. I was shocked."
893,M Kemp (United Kingdom) 18th February 2017,4/10,"""Short-sighted management or what?""","✅ Verified Review |  This a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to Business Class passengers. We were flying to Mauritius on holiday and I felt, given the flying time, we should spoil ourselves and fly up-front with all the 'comparative' comfort of Business Class. The British Airways flight itself was okay, the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine. However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it's all part of the Business Class experience). To illustrate my point, I attach a shot of what Walsh's policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare-paying passengers. With the very confusing layout that greets one in the South Terminal now that BA have moved in, the 'serve yourself' check-in (you even label your own bags!). I was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the 'Lounge'. But then to be greeted with this, was totally unacceptable. So, Willie, rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this sort of display of overt cost-cutting has now lost you revenue for the future. Short-sighted management or what? Take a lesson from Emirates who I decided to fly home with, so disgusted was I over our experience. They put passengers first!"
894,C Drew (United Kingdom) 18th February 2017,4/10,"""a reasonable experience""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Vancouver return.Both flights were punctual but sadly the 747-400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age, especially compared to the A380s BA have used on this route. The cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight. I was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room. The IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings. On the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do well. Food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was very well organised, less so at the Heathrow end. It is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped Terminal 3 at Heathrow. Overall a reasonable experience, but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish."

C Read (United Kingdom) 17th February 2017",7/10,"""Flight barely a quarter full""","✅ Verified Review |  Return trip from Washington Dulles to London Heathrow. Flight was barely a quarter full. Going to Washington flight was probably only about a third full. Attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen. Given that I was on an A380 it really did look empty. Food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old. Plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I'd flown on. I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet. No real gripes although the ""snack"" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffee. Flight cost £430 and using some airmiles I knocked this down to £330. Loads of interactive channels to watch but films weren't the best but that's a personal thing."

I informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc. Our other complaint was the food - it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times. In short I would not recommend flying with BA."

A Wong (China) 16th February 2017",1/10,"""service good, food adequate""","✅ Verified Review | London to Hong Kong with British Airways. The flight is good as I booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying BA to get this best seat 16K, other seats are below standard for long haul business. Yet a similar seat on an A380 is better. Service is good and food is adequate. I fly this route many times on BA rather than CX: CX is better but BA better priced, and that is, if you get the best seat. 7 points for B777 and 8 for A380."

A Wong (China) 16th February 2017",7/10,"""flight OK with snack and drink""","✅ Verified Review | Flying British Airways from Paris to London is less convenient as they are the only major airline that has the check in counter located one floor down at basement, but good that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the Cathay Pacific lounge as this caters for long haul passengers. Boarding on time but held in tarmac for half an hour, not BA's fault. The pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minutes to have lost the allotted time, so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stair deplane and coach connection, but good that business passengers are taken away first in a separate car. The flight is OK with snack and drink."
899,Christopher Loftus (United States) 16th February 2017,8/10,"""British Airways has declined badly""","✅ Verified Review |  Chicago to London Heathrow. Don't waste your money buying BA seat assignments in advance! I did that a month ago, at the same time as I made my booking, and paid for an aisle seat of my choice. When I went back one week before my journey, my aisle seat was gone and I was placed in an undesirable middle seat. There was no remedy for this. Five calls over three days to BA connected me to people in Delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately, sorry, and just no. I have been deceived, lied to, and put off. I have flown British many times; this is absolutely my last time. It is acceptable to make an error, but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it. Take my advice, choose another airline. I am a OneWorld emerald flyer on AA, flew 200k miles last year, and I can tell good service from bad. British Airways has unfortunately declined badly."

K Peck (United Kingdom) 8th February 2017",5/10,"""service is like budget airlines""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Barcelona. Unimpressed with the new M&S on board service. Boarding process badly organised and the cabin crew cabin bags (quite a few) were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their bags overhead. I had to put my bag much behind my row. It's not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines, but sadly I booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard."
901,Gillian Seaton (United Kingdom) 8th February 2017,1/10,"""quality dropped dramatically""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro. 45 minute delay on the tarmac. Air conditioning wasn't working during delay - would only work once engines were on. The cabin was therefore unbearably hot. The foam in my seat 30B had deteriorated to the point I could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone. I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. This is a 12 hour flight and I don't think this is acceptable. I was very uncomfortable during this flight. In flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blipping. In flight snacks now have to be paid for. Considering the price of flights, I think this is very poor. British Airways is not a budget airline. In fact airlines currently rated lower than BA in the Top 100 airlines (eg Virgin Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines) still provide complimentary on board snacks. There were two in flight meals on this flight - on both occasions I was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out. Once, I could forgive - but twice? When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'. How rude! I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff. The quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. No crackers or cheese, no fruit. What is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake (both of which I intensely dislike). This is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting. I'd had no choice in your menu, and what was served up was unpalatable. I have to take medication that needs to be taken with food - I had no choice but to purchase food on board. An additional charge on an already expensive flight is a 'hard pill to swallow'."
902,David Brittain (United Kingdom) 8th February 2017,3/10,"""I will never fly with BA again""","❎ Unverified |  London Heathrow to New York. Paid £250 to pre-book my seats as my wife is a nervous flyer and likes a window seat. Before we even left BA changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying us. Luckily I spotted this on the booking portal and changed them back to a window seat. To cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo! On complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund. I was told 'they are always doing this'. On returning back to the UK on Christmas Eve I contacted Customer Service and was told I would receive a refund (I took the Customer Services Operators name and ID number) - no refund. I completed the on-line complaints form - I received an acknowledgment - nothing happened. I wrote to the Chief Executive, no acknowledgement, nothing. I wrote to the Refunds Department, no acknowledgement, nothing. I chased Customer Services again and was told the Refund Department is so busy. I will never fly with BA again. To quote British Airway Customers Service response ""I completely understand why you’re unhappy you didn’t get your preferred seats. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you. I hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon."" My response was that 'I don't think so'."

The Boeing 777 outbound was a bit scruffy but overall a good experience. The new IFE had been installed on the inbound aircraft, but moving map inoperable and seemed to have been loaded with very few movies and TV options. Crew excellent on all flights. I continue to favor BA for long trips - they really work hard. The seat rests do not come up all the way but this was the only annoyance. Not sure if I like the new charges for food on the European legs - 5GBP was steep for coffee and tea in plastic cups."

The flight got cancelled due to bad weather at IST, this is understood,  but when we tried to reschedule the flight, we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who did not know how or what they should do as Istanbul airport was shut due to snow. We nearly got rebooked on a flight to Munich which we refused as BA ticketing agent did not know that the Turkish incoming flight to Munich was cancelled - I had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to Munich where we would have got stranded. In total we were stranded at Heathrow for 15 hours and managed after that to fly to Istanbul via Athens on Aegean Airlines at 22:30 and the next day from Athens being delayed by nearly 21 hours. When finally we got the option to travel Via Athens, We had to go and collect our luggage, When we asked for the Pre-Arranged assistance for my Mother, we were told No assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed help. We had to walk the very long distance back through immigration from BA’s lounge at T5. We went to what was marked as Luggage Desk (Club Word), were told to go alone to collect our luggage out of nearly 2000 pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled. When asked for transport to T2, a train was offered which links the terminals - had to take a taxi at a cost of £20.00 to get to T2. I asked for a refund of part of the ticket, I received a general reply without any joy! British Airways need to look around you and learn from other airlines, I was surprised with the standards of Aegean Airlines, so pleasant staff, clean aircraft, the comfort of the seat and quality of the food. All which are missing with BA."

Food is good for a short-haul flight in business class, but I note that there is no longer free snack and drink in Economy. Now they sell M&S stuff. But the question is whether it is worth the while flying business short-haul. I did only because it is one of my long haul segments. I expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation."

909,Peter Crameri (France) 6th February 2017,4/10,"""the wines are not good""","❎ Unverified |  Bordeaux to London Gatwick. As a former Executive Gold card holder (7 years running), my long haul travels had stopped due to change of job so sadly lost my status, back to ""blue"". I have just started flying again with British Airways and, just recently, the Bordeaux to Gatwick route, once served by a 737-400 and now replaced by the more modern A320. To my surprise the cabin looks very nice (although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of Ryanair) and has a pleasant feeling. Sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now (economy) but the wines are not good (I am a wine trade professional). If the food is ""M&S"" concept, why don't they get M&S to supply them the wines too? Years ago the selection process at British Airways was different and the wines were then great! But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same route. My next BA trip is on February 18th, this time to Shanghai. I am concerned, though, to read the generally appalling comments about BA's long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight, in economy! I hope BA is taking these comments onboard seriously."
910,Vincent Borlaug (United States) 30th January 2017,5/10,"""still my first choice""","✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Barcelona return via London (premium economy transatlantic, economy on short haul). Comfortable flights and first-rate cabin service both ways. A late departure from BCN on the return trip due to fog in London was largely made up for and I made my connection to Washington with time to spare. Also, my checked bag did not make it on the original flight to Barcelona but a claim was put in for and my bag was delivered to my hotel the following morning. Concerning the M&S food and drink service on European sectors, I don't normally eat on short-hauls, but I did note that one of the drinks on offer in this service is my favourite ale, Old Speckled Hen, not previously seen by me on an airline (I paid with Avios). I don't enjoy having to pay for something that was once available for free, but sometimes there are compensations. BA is still my first choice for international travel and get me to/from my destination in comfort and with attentive, friendly service."

How British Airways have fallen in their service and product - they are no better than Ryanair now and frankly unless LHR is convenient to you, I would seek another airline. Not even a drink offered unless you pay although another passenger stated water was free but it was not offered. Seats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anything. I checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that I immediately ripped off. The only benefit was my frequent flier tier meant I got early boarding, this is my last trip through LHR as the connection procedure is so awful. American Airlines are now better than British Airways and that says it all."

Have flown Virgin, Thomas Cook etc outstandingly BA the worst. Fly Virgin."
914,P Eden (United Kingdom) 29th January 2017,2/10,"""how the mighty have fallen""","✅ Verified Review |  How the mighty have fallen, or should I say continue to fall. My partner and I booked tickets from London to Johannesburg back in September 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a result. As I left the aircraft I received a text from BA asking for feedback on the flight, I took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. Whilst I was in Johannesburg I tried to contact/ call Johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at BA is like trying to get an audience with Pope Francis! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. In summary, I eventually was offered £15 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn. Looking back, the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me."

After a disorganized boarding, the door of the aircraft was closed 15 minutes late. Then the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure, because of fog in the morning at Heathrow Airport. At the end we arrived with 1.5 hours delay in Zurich. When airborne we were informed about the new catering concept (!) of British Airways for Economy Class Passengers on European flights. You have to pay for food and the drinks.

Boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew. Seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards, cabin was reasonably clean. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. The time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. This was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etc. What a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary service. Sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of Lufthansa and Air France."
917,Bill Atkins (United Kingdom) 27th January 2017,2/10,"""good experience both flights""","❎ Unverified |  London Heathrow to Philadelphia return. Very good experience both flights. Mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service, very energetic younger crew on return, where everything happened quickly and efficiently. Both crews friendly and had control of the cabin, which made for a relaxed atmosphere. Food noticeably better than of late - I hope this will continue. On return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog, but rebooking had been done by the time I checked in in PHL and I had a text message also to that effect. Concorde Room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed, but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much. All in all good solid enjoyable flights. I would add that this review applies to my most recent experience as others have not been so positive."
918,Gerald Pitcher (United Kingdom) 26th January 2017,9/10,"""they have lost absolutely their unique selling points""","✅ Verified Review |  The decline of British Airways. My review is primarily on BA Euro Traveller in economy. Up to two years ago one felt good when travelling BA. They were miles ahead of budget airlines. Yes they were a bit more expensive, but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage, checked in cases of 20kg, all part of the service. Today BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggage. Today, within Europe, BA has absolutely no advantage opposite EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even Ryanair. Why should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. Incidentally coming back from Malta to London Gatwick in BA in business class, there is nowhere to hang coats. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. And now NO CUPBOARDS! Extra seats instead. The Decline and Fall of a once proud BA. In future BA will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines."
919,E Sapiwu (Canada) 26th January 2017,2/10,"""vowed to never fly with BA""","✅ Verified Review |  I was returning home for my wedding on December 27, 2016, connecting to British Airways from London Heathrow to Abuja. The seat I had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet. I never got an explanation for this action. However, I wasn't very fussy about this as I was very excited to be getting married. Also, the flight was dirty, the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place. Our flight arrived at the Abuja airport and I was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within Nigeria. I went to claim my luggage at the carousel, I waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and I couldn't find my luggage which had my wedding items in it, including my wedding dress. As you can imagine I was devastated, I had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue. I spent the night at Abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one BA flight arrives from Heathrow to Abuja each day. My luggage never arrived the next day. Myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items. The BA staff at the airport weren't helpful at all, they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was. My luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape. Up till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven't refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them. BA ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and I have vowed to never fly with BA."

Niina Ursin (United Kingdom) 21st January 2017",5/10,"""will never fly with BA again""","✅ Verified Review |  Never again! Booked a round trip from to London from Paris return with British Airways in business as had a separate ticket from Paris to Johannesburg (with AF in business class) and Cape Town to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. The plan was to get refreshed in the lounge, rest for few hours and get on the flight. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was ""well, get a bus"". No indication of where. The woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. Tried to get some more information to which the reply was ""go online"". She gave me a paper which I thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. Thought ok, at least something. The next shock, when I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy! As I was very tired and just wanted to get home, agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. Was told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complain. Gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating ""go online, I don't care about BA"". When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. Complained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensation. Generic reply after 5 minutes was, no compensation. Needless to say, I will never fly with BA again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who I frequently fly with in business class and am a FF (luckily not of BA)."

Not enough toilets. Tiny PTV screen and poor movie selection. Crew was very friendly and helpful. We had to face the bad mood of the ground staff in London who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the London to Paris flight. We explained that we were in Business class and that we flew with the same cases at the beginning of our vacation, they didn't care and refused us to bring it on board. After 30 minutes I showed that they were of a size allowed by BA. They recognized their mistake and let us take it. 30 minutes of stress because they didn't do their job properly. Won't fly BA again, except for the cabin crew everything was bad and looking like budget airline."

Russell Taylor (Japan) 20th January 2017",1/10,"""ludicrous approach to carry on baggage""",✅ Verified Review | Glasgow to London Gatwick with British Airways. Absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flight. I arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin. I struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight. No idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight. Pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly.

Seats 62J/K on upper deck excellent for a couple, although the plane was looking its age, with patching up wherever you looked. IFE long past its due replacement date, with small screen and poor resolution. Cabin crew friendly enough. Meal the usual sub-standard BA fare, with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains. Hotel Chocolat chocs have now disappeared. Arrival at CPT only 30 mins behind schedule. Cape Town to London, the Galleries lounge at CPT spacious, but quickly became packed with pax from two flights. Food options dreadful, with the worst hot food we've encountered in any business class lounge. Cheese pre-packaged. MCC available but no champagne. Push back 15 mins ahead of schedule. Same seats on upper deck. Meal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast. Arrived ahead of schedule. Overall, the flight itself was the usual BA service. Onboard was another matter, with seats and service way below BA's competitors and at inflated prices."

P Simpson (United Kingdom) 18th January 2017",6/10,"""would I fly in BA First again? No""","✅ Verified Review | In September 2016, I flew with British Airways in First from London to Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033. Initial impressions were positive. The check-in was efficient with polite and friendly staff. The Concorde Room was a nice place to be. My First suite (2A) offered a good amount of comfort, space and privacy. Fast forward 12+ hours. Would I fly in British Airways First again? No. Would I fly with British Airways again? No. This is why: On the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the First cabin, with 8 passengers. The 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. I had to ask twice for a replacement set. It took over 40 minutes to receive this. Once airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. There were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served. It took over 2 hours to get my dinner. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). It would appear that this passenger had a higher Executive Club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. I was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order). This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. There were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. The First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. The ‘You First’ department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer Relations. No attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaint. This was disappointing. I was simply offered 10,000 Avios points. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”. I found this statement somewhat ironic."
926,Alan Whitlock (United Kingdom) 18th January 2017,2/10,"""reduced to that of a budget airline""","✅ Verified Review |  St Petersburgh to London. I don’t know where BA got this market research to say stop complementary meals, we prefer to pay for it ! I’ve yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion. If you want to buy something different, you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding. I suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true, though I suspect the real reason is cost cutting, BA just doesn’t want to admit it. BA would be better off to admit it, customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same, we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good. To tell me that charging £1.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when I can buy the same thing in Tesco for 63p insults my intelligence, they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market, again a great image to promote to the world. Where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a BA passenger where any alternative exists. Pay extra for checked luggage, Pay extra for drinks, pay extra for food, I’m sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a budget airline."
927,H Anderson (China) 18th January 2017,2/10,"""a budget airline at premium airline prices""","✅ Verified Review |  British Airways is a budget airline at premium airline prices. Flew from Gatwick to Cancun. However, if you wanted snacks (on a very long flight) you have to buy them on board, and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry. You do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight. There was also nowhere to plug in laptops, which you expect on a long and expensive flight-especially when you have work to do. The plane was also so cold (too cold to concentrate on work). It would take a great deal to choose them again."
928,Y Li (China) 17th January 2017,2/10,"""incompetence and insincerity""","✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to Zurich via London return, and British Airways is absolutely appalling. I have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline. I booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and I to go from Shanghai to Zurich via London. On the way there, the flight to Zurich was cancelled due to French strike, not BA's fault so that part is clear. However, they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled, furthermore, they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours (after a 12 hours flight) to go through customs (thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers), find a hotel, arrange our own transport there and back. So the first leg already left a terrible impression. Then, on the way back to Shanghai, they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I to economy for a 12 hour flight. I booked premium economy for a reason, my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? No. Told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat, then at boarding, told us sorry it's either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat. Because I had work the next day, we had no option but to fly and BA ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap. Three months down the track, I have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbers/emails to write to, only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole. Needless to say I will forever boycott BA for its incompetence and insincerity towards a paying customer."
929,M Cooper (United Kingdom) 17th January 2017,1/10,"""plane had not been cleaned well""","✅ Verified Review |  We travelled Business Class from Gatwick to Barbados return for Christmas 2016. The outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all - food crumbs around seat area, stained carpets, wet toilet floors etc. The cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we ""hang it up wherever you can find space"" - we collected our own coats prior to landing. When the food was served we had been noted as 'not eating' - when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess, the two hot options were unavailable - I had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without. The quality of the video/audio was very poor - the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable. On the return flight the Executive Lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal. During the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum - not a very professional image! On our return the only response by BA to our complaints was additional Avios Points - an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of."

Outbound flight was delayed due to engine problem just before taking off with consequent 5 hours delays. BA did look after us well though. Replacement aircraft found (another A320) and we safely arrived to destination. Cabin crew was very helpful and polite. Return on an old but still good looking B767 (I believe they will be phased out in 2017) which has plenty of legroom and space in economy, although the overhead bins are not too spacious (I guess that is the way they used to be). We departed and landed on time. Overall a good experience despite the outbound delay but I prefer airlines that are able to make safety calls to those that would not!"

Two hours late, and terrible service when able to board. The flight attendants seemed too young, and they did not care to anyones concerns. I now see why, British Airways has lost it class, they really don't care about the customer. I can honestly say I will never fly British Airways again, no matter if they are the lowest priced carrier."
932,Lynda Wenham-Jones (United Kingdom) 10th January 2017,2/10,"""make sure you pack a sandwich""","✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Barbados return. We were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to Barbados. After take off we were served complimentary drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been abolished but wasn't unduly concerned. Dinner was served shortly afterwards which I was good although cheese and biscuits had been cut too. The flight time was almost 9 hours so we were feeling hungry 4 hours after the main meal. I was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat, a small bag of crisps or 2 small biscuits! The cabin staff told me it was the new policy, and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles!  There were not even any sandwiches for sale! Fortunately for us soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and I noticed she was carrying a sandwich, I asked her where she had got it, and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it!  No one advised us that there was only one meal in 9 hours, if so we would have bought a sandwich with us. I looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut backs. So if your planning on travelling with British Airways economy to Barbados make sure you pack a sandwich. Return flight we was prepared as only a biscuit was given out. Will be travelling with Virgin next time!"

I'm always reminded that British Airways is one of the worst airlines every time I fly with them. The check in service is as bad as they get. They have sent my bags to Heathrow even though I'm going to LAX. I expect them to know, check, or at least ask where I'm going. To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight. Staff have attitude across the board. Poor food on long haul flights. Struggling to think of many ways they could be worse. A real embarrassment that British Airways is my country's main airline."

I went to the trouble of checking in online, printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my bag at the airport, to be told that is not allowed! I was told I had no option but to queue up with everybody else checking in. After 1 hour in the horrific queue, I am told there is ""no space for a bag drop at Manchester T3"". The agent said this with 4 empty check-in desks next to her. British Airways disgust me with this hoop-jumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feet. Thank you for the complimentary micro-bag of crisps on the delayed LHR-MAN leg! If I never see BA/AA ever again it'll be too soon."
937,P Brown (United Kingdom) 5th January 2017,1/10,"""have once again been disappointed by British Airways""","✅ Verified Review |  Miami to London Business Class. Living in London, and flying international long haul flights throughout the year I have once again been disappointed by British Airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins. Our family of four were travelling home from the Christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when I was ready to sleep I attempted to recline my seat in the ""flat bed position"". My seat would not recline. The flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. These are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. Sadly, he did not. I was informed that the head/purser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half. Hopefully his accommodations were better than mine. Prior to landing (20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight), the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10,000 Avios. I informed him there was a far greater price point between Premium Economy vs. Business Class. Understandably, he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing. I received a call from a BA representative and I was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation - £50 or 10,000 Avios. (I currently have 588,500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to use). I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from Heathrow to Atlanta from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat. The BA representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the Business Class experience - the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. Sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a Business Class seat - not the food. My comfort was not met. The flight attendants on BA have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin, the point was to sleep."
938,C Richards (Australia) 5th January 2017,2/10,"""cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle""","✅ Verified Review |  I've flown this route (Sydney to London) many times with other airlines and British Airways is the worst. They changed our seats during the fuel stop at Singapore - without notice, without explanation. The food was terrible - no fruit or green vegetable to be seen. Cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy - bumped into numerous times. Toilet locations on board are terrible - those poor people seated right next to the WC door. Paid extra for reserved seats - no confirmation. Inflight entertainment was awful - really, really old movies. This airline trades on some nostalgic image as if they were in the 1950's. Other airlines are far superior. Don't risk it - you'll be disappointed."
939,Stephane Parent (France) 5th January 2017,1/10,"""too much cost cutting""","✅ Verified Review |  Paris CDG to Bangkok via London Heathrow in Business Class. It was my first flight with BA, and probably my last one. BA is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cutting. In business class each row has 8 seats, never seen that in a recent business class, and you can forget any privacy. The seat is comfortable in sitting position but becomes not comfy in bed position as you have to open a second tiny seat to put your feet. Not convenient. The IFE screen is tiny, smaller than in economy in recent airplanes. The movie selection was very poor. The meal was bad and quantity was very poor. 3 tiny toilets for the business class, not enough."

We tried comforting them walking with them etc but couldn't stop them. I went to the galley and requested for a snack for my daughters and was told the meal will be served shortly. However, it took an hour at least to serve the meal. The twins continued crying as they didn't eat the main meal. I went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored! Eventually a Steward came to collect a trolley for Business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help. I explained the situation to him and he gave me a packet which contained two biscuits. I thanked him and left. The cabin staff would rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated, tired, hungry children. has lost my custom and I won't be flying with BA ever again!"

The Captain took the trouble to broadcast a message to waiting passengers in the departure lounge. He explained, very succinctly, about the fog delay and made sure we knew there was no guarantee about take-off time. He gave passengers the choice not to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them. He explained we need to be onboard, ready to fly at a moment's notice, but we could be waiting 4 to 5 hours. We boarded and fortunately were away only two and a half hours late. I had never known that kind of communication before with delays"". I would like our appreciation to be passed on to the Captain and crew that day."
943,A Hillier (Luxembourg) 23rd December 2016,10/10,"""a dirty seat and cabin""","Frankfurt to Cape Town via London Heathrow. The short haul legs were short and efficient and seat is standard for European business class. The salad was good, I didn't like the dessert. Heathrow to Cape Town on old Boeing 747-400, and even though this is still one of my favorite aircraft, the business class on was the old one. The seat itself was comfortable and I prefer to be shielded from other passengers, but no stowage space for small items around your seat, not possible to watch TV during take off. There is not much to watch anyway, and a dirty seat and cabin. No USB plug or at least an international plug but only a UK plug. How international. The full flat bed is good if you are shorter than 187cm. This is the only airline in business class long haul that has 6 seat in a row. The service was good, but needs some nicer touches though. Look at what others are offering, British Airways are way behind. The cabin crew was professional and friendly and it all came down to the attendant on our side. She gave her all to ensure a good flightIt is sad that legacy carriers now go the same road as low cost carriers instead of opting for better quality."
944,P Greeson (United States) 22nd December 2016,7/10,"""no customer loyalty sought""","✅ Verified Review |  Baltimore Washington to London Heathrow. Bad start for my first trip on British Airways. Extra cost for decent seat, meant nothing. Bought a mid-cabin seat for my wife and I. Flight delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical problem. So for the insult of paying for reasonable seats, my wife and I were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft - no refund, just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at Heathrow. Overall a loss of a half day. Thinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wasted. A couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. A suggestion that access to the British Airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment. No real remorse, matter of fact responses like gee, this happens a lot and good luck. No customer loyalty sought. Dispassionate, professional, but not really friendly. Staff seemed tired and overworked at counters."
945,Chris Masters (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2016,1/10,"""not allowed to choose a seat""",✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Prague. As a Gold exec member I was mortified to find out that as a Gold member we were not allowed to choose a seat or exit seat. My seat allocation may have been in the rear toilet it was that far back. Also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with Avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines. How sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice. Why do you think people chose British Airways? As they are more expensive? Because of the service and being like it used to be to fly without taking a picnic with you.

Chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggy. White wine good red poor. Breakfast scrambled eggs and steak! Spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible. I got a decent sleep."
947,M Dammud (Canada) 21st December 2016,7/10,"""give this rotten airline 0/10""","✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Toronto via London, and I tried to check-in online. However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA’s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a “random” security hold by airport authorities. When I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing ETA for travel to Canada. When I informed her that could not be the case as I was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA’s control. The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. As I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future leadership. In any case, this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Such is the competency and class of this “manager” but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage – adding salt to wound. I flew to London from Dubai several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them. Finally, I called the UK ""Customer Relations"" center from Toronto, but I gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. They are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too. I wish I could give this rotten airline 0/10, but the minimum is 1/10 and I am happy with that."

After many horrible experiences on BA, I am convinced this airline has total contempt not only for its customers but even for top tier elite frequent flyers. I am AA Executive Platinum and I am being treated worse than cattle - forced to check in carry-on bag which is within the BA limits on multiple occasions, denied boarding, zero upgrade policy, zero flexibility when being forcefully re-booked (recently I had to pay £300 in addition to an already expensive £400 ticket for a 2 hr EU flight). I live in London and I'm a loyal American Airlines frequent flyer clocking around 200,000 miles a year. I will avoid British Airways even if it means an extra connection, flying a low cost carrier or not flying at all."

My first bad experience earlier this year was to be told that my seat has been sold and they could not take me onboard. I had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so I could wait having a refreshment. But this 10th December was just not acceptable, and my last trip with them. I had three flights lined up. San Diego to Seville, all three operated with British Airways. Their first plane was late by two hours. By the time we arrived into London I had lost my connecting flight. They said I was on my own because I booked them separately so I had to buy new tickets and pay for my own stay overnight. Their behaviour is one of a cheap airline that cannot be relied on and in case of delay does not help you to get to your destination."

Overall British Airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience. Ground staff at DFW were OK though there was no agent in the lounge till about 3 hours before departure. On board the seat if flat, but very narrow. Food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china; no flair and was unimaginative at best. Crew on both flights were fairly mediocre - just went through the motions but didn't seem particularly interested in passenger service at all.The second meal on LHR-BOM was the worst meal I have had on an airplane - literally a deep fried potato and thats it. Lounge at LHR was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection- sad display for their main hub. Overall I would not fly on BA by choice given their mediocre product.

British Airways Club World seats are barely wider than coach, and the curvature of the shell makes it feel tighter in the shoulders than coach until the seat is almost half reclined. Profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat as there is a hard bulge at the hinge, best sleeping position is with head elevated a few inches. Could barely wedge myself into the window seat despite unrestricted aisle access, couldn't get out of the seat without putting my hand on and pulling down the seat divider. Footstool that makes up lower part of flat bed came unhooked and dropped to the floor four times on preceding flight. Plane is new with great windows. Restrooms a bit cramped compared to Airbus 330. Flight crew was fine, meal service was adequate, wines were good, in-flight kitchen has been cut back to almost nothing. My upgrade was heavily discounted and I would never pay full price for Club World."

I arrived at Manchester terminal 3 at 08:00 and checked in to my booked flights. My outbound transfer flight BA1389 was delayed by over 3 hours (schedule 09:55, actual 13:10). At Manchester airport, the BA service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers. After a 2 hour queue, they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service desk. I boarded the late flight to Manchester, hoping that BA Heathrow could help me with the connecting Virgin Atlantic flight when I arrived at Heathrow. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to Shanghai. My flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 (Schedule 11:05, actual 14:06). Upon arrival at Heathrow (14:30), I proceeded to go to the BA service desk at Terminal 5 to find the next flights to Shanghai. After a 1 hour wait in the queue, the BA service personnel were not only unhelpful, but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. They refused to help me book another flight to Shanghai, they refused to book me on a flight back to Manchester, they refused to help me retrieve my luggage, they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the £1814.60 air fare. I explained that I was now stranded in Heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage, but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further. When I pleaded with the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers. At no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that I was in.  I was left outside Terminal 5 with no transport, no accommodation and no luggage. Eventually, after asking several helpful members of airport staff, I retrieved my luggage from Terminal 2. I organised myself a hotel in Heathrow at 20:00 after an exhausting 12 hours and now need to figure out how to get home."

Quite enjoyable flights both ways with first-rate leg-room (38in in WTP vs 31in in regular WT remains a strong positive point with me), some of the best airline cuisine I've had in recent years, an excellent pre-meal drinks service including Tribute Cornish ale, on-time departure/arrival and the attentive, courteous cabin-crew service I've received through the years from British Airways. (Two tiny flyspecks though - no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service, but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip.) This remains my favourite way of flying between the USA and Europe. I am a regular Skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews BA's regular tourist-class service has latterly received in this forum (haven't flown it myself in a couple of years though), but on this and other recent showings BA's World Traveller Plus premium economy remains as good as ever."

How they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery, with the onboard product being simply awful - and this on a newer Boeing 787 plane! The cabin was tatty - tables loose, problems with seat recline mechanism, IFE clunky and slow. The food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving. Amenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and whilst the flight was quite empty in business, the service seemed to be on a go-slow. Staff (when they appeared in the cabin) were quite friendly, but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that BA now provide. I will go back to using my preferred Asian airlines, and I can only assume other BA ""loyals"" will also start switching as the management seem intent on driving BA down to low cost airline levels."
958,Andrew Staton (United Kingdom) 8th December 2016,3/10,"""disinterested and unhelpful""","Appalling food, especially on the Orlando-Gatwick return leg. Choice of a horrible-smelling curry and a vegetarian pasta, the pasta was as if it had been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory. There was a roll but no butter, instead a tiny pot of 'spread' that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered. For 'breakfast' we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick. No juice etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable. The flight attendant suggested that I should recline my seat as well and couldn't understand when I refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite. Eventually the passenger in front of me must have got the message because she put her seat back off her own bat. I felt very sad that my national airline of British Airways has lowered itself to these standards of food and customer service. The seat was OK but nothing to write home about."

C Fordham (United States) 8th December 2016",2/10,"""service .. we don't really care""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Seattle on a redemption ticket in premium economy. Boarding and departure both efficient. A few empty seats in the separate cabin so that contributed to a relaxed flight. Service was casual to the point of ""we don't really care"". Food acceptable - just. IFE adequate. Seat became uncomfortable in the last 3 or 4 hours of the flight."
960,R Christie (United Kingdom) 5th December 2016,5/10,"""aircraft are very old""","✅ Verified Review | British Airways from London to Bangkok return. If you are thinking about flying British Airways to Bangkok. Don't do it. Thai Airways or Eva Air for the same price offer a much better service (for direct flights). If you want the best go with Emirates but it's a stop over flight. I fly this route 20 times a year. Here are the key reasons why you should not fly with British Airways. From my experience I believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying. The aircraft are very old. If you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you 'Can you wait? service is in 20 mins' this has been tested a few times. They hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers. The next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins. Entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm. No phone charger and no USB port. No Wifi. Seats are very old, very uncomfortable"
961,Simon Castleman (United Kingdom) 4th December 2016,1/10,"""the crew were pleasant and efficient""","Good service flying from London to Madrid, attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg. Outbound leg the crew were pleasant and efficient. On the return leg the crew were one of the most attentive and approachable I have met on a BA flight in quite some time. Food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered. The only gripe I have is that unless you are a One World Emerald card holder you can't select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay £22 per person per sector. I think it's a British Airways thing. Even the LCCs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost. Paying business class prices I expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status. I think this policy is misguided and I will take this into consideration in booking future flights."
962,C Draper (Australia) 4th December 2016,8/10,"""hit a new low for me""","✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Sydney in business class. The price was lowish so we booked—never again. Seat comfort was almost non-existent with appalling ergonomics. The in-flight service hit a new low for me: absolutely shambolic, no team effort, aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers. Food and drink were cut-price and worsened by late wine and bread. No water offered and meal items forgotten. Entertainment choices were sub-par. No noise-cancelling headphones. No cosmetics in the dirty toilets. A dollar-shop amenity bag. I have had better economy experiences than this sector. Shame on you British Airways."
963,B Najati (United Kingdom) 3rd December 2016,1/10,"""one of the worst journeys""","✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to London, seats 22K and 22J. It was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail. My other half who is 6'3"" was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90% of the flight. The small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort. He couldn't even watch the in-flight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. As a shorter limbed person at 5'4"", I was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight. Placed in the middle, I barely had any where to put myself, seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build. My headphone socket was crackling and the film I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time) wasn't working, it was just a black screen with audio. After travelling long haul last year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on BA. Within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers. On BA we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink. On this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers. Would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with BA long haul ever again."
964,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 3rd December 2016,1/10,"""relegating to a low cost airline""","A good flight from Heathrow to Stockholm. Busy and chaotic boarding as didn't board by row number. Therefore boarding took forever and with an excess of hand luggage, flight was then late. On board meal now a bag of crisps or biscuits but I know that by January even that will have gone, thereby relegating BA to a low cost airline. Not surprised mind you, as they have to compete with the others, but BA will need to keep their prices keen. Female crew were as friendly as ever. Males less so."
965,M Warburton (United Kingdom) 2nd December 2016,6/10,"""closer to low-cost carriers""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Zurich return using their business class. Online check in and easy access through security at Heathrow. Lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminal. Seats onboard A321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom / seat pitch. Food also shows reals signs of cost reduction, and BA is very much closer to low-cost carriers than airlines like Lufthansa or Swiss. Staff service was best described as ""perfunctory"" - they provide F&B and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their Christmas plans. Return flight no different, except that cabin staff did manage to say hello as we boarded flight. BA has become a very expensive and disappointing way to fly."
966,S Long (United Kingdom) 1st December 2016,3/10,"""the service was merely adequate""","What a disappointing experience flying British Airways from London Gatwick to Mauritius. Flew club class and the service was merely adequate, they did what they had to do and no more - at no point we were made to feel valued customers. A request for a cup of tea after dinner, resulted in no tea brought (it was allegedly given to another passenger), when we had fruit as a dessert, it was given with no plate, bread at breakfast was also given without a plate - had to be put directly onto the tray. On the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine, weren't available to view. Given that we paid a lot of money for these tickets, the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly. BA now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price. Flew Emirates last year to Mauritius and there is no comparison. Emirates wins hands down. BA needs to get its act together as it will loose customers."
967,A Oldham (United Kingdom) 30th November 2016,3/10,"""absolute disgrace""","✅ Verified Review |  Absolute disgrace. They cancelled my flight 1 hour and 45 minutes before the the flight and put me on the next flight with 3 hours 15 minutes delay. I do have VIP access to the lounges, however, non of the lounges in T5 accepts my lounge access card/company. When I asked the BA staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting £5 worth of voucher. Surely they can do better than that. It probably doesn't mean anything to BA, but I am not a happy customer."
968,W Cole (United Kingdom) 30th November 2016,1/10,"""it was not a pleasant flight""","✅ Verified Review |  Bassinets by British Airways cater for newborn only. My 10 month old son could not fit in it. The only option was a child seat, however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat. The only option is to sleep on you. However the arm rests are fixed in and hard. Couple that with the need to breast feed your child, with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat, either his head would get banged on the armrest or he'd kick the armrest at the other end. It was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from London to Hong Kong. Other airlines offer bassinets up to one years, some even 2 years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours. Imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can't fit in the seat. And every so often you fear he'll fall off your lap. To travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and British airways refuse to do anything about it."

P Mercer (United Kingdom) 29th November 2016",1/10,"""greatest assets is its cabin crew""","Check-in at Singapore Airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly, efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal. Boarding was chaotic. After announcing families with children, first and club passengers, and cardholders, the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. As before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight. It seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs, British Airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small. Nevertheless, the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits. After a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and I slept soundly for several hours. The seat is equipped with two USB ports but these put out such little power by iPhone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an iPad. We landed at Heathrow on time and reached Terminal 5 within a matter of minutes. One of British Airways’ greatest assets is its cabin crew who, in my experience, are considerably better than their rivals. What the airline needs to do is to stop attempting to save money and start giving its premium class passengers those little extras that they have become accustomed to on other airlines. It might have been a one-off but it also needs to ensure that boarding is carried out properly."

Connor Sadler (United Kingdom) 26th November 2016",5/10,"""crew not overly friendly""","London Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. After experiencing the modern T5, we boarded our flight on time and got sat down. We were in an older 777-200, so the seats weren't very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small. We departed late as they had to unload bags, they also had to reset the entertainment system. In the air we were offered beverages. Later in the flight, the meal service. There was chicken curry (I had it - it was nice but the rice was a bit dry) and a pink-looking coleslaw as a side salad. The dessert was a butterscotch/chocolate mousse, which was good. The other alternative was a pasta. I watched some films - there was a good range - and I like how the BBC News is up to date so I could catch up with the current affairs. The crew were not overly friendly, but kept servicing us with extra drinks. I had a nap, and then we were served a small landing snack. The much rumoured Mars Bar is actually true, as well as some Belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks. We landed on time, but had to stay on the plane until the immigration hallway became a bit clearer."
971,J Caws (Germany) 25th November 2016,6/10,"""the value for money is no longer given""","✅ Verified Review |  First leg DUS to LHR was Club Europe. While business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. It was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. Crumbs on the seat. Table was sticky. Asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. Overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. Next leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still old. The housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. Asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. In general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the IFE and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). Lounge in LHR very outdated. Boarding in LHR was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. Crew on board once again very friendly and effective. Meal choice was ok. But my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. Club Kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of BA is a joke nowadays. Selection seems to go down every time I fly. Worst of all: One of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. This itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. After identifying that my bag seems to be lost I went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in Boston). I explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that I did not checked another bag -> although I had my tag that I could show to her. I had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. Manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. No apologies for inconvience at all. Last year I had one bag that was delayed. This handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. Extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. Summarizing: Flying BA for business for many years and on a regular basis now. The changes under the new boss can be seen. While in the past British Airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. This time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BA. I assume that if there is no change in the near term I will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. If you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that I am not the only one thinking like this. I can't any longer recommend BA as especially the value for money is no longer given."

P Mercer (United Kingdom) 25th November 2016",5/10,"""could not fault anything""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Singapore in first class was British Airways at its best. The Concorde Lounge was well staffed and the food and wine was exquisite. I was welcomed to the First Class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crew. There was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagne. Throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly, helpful and interested as well as anticipating what I needed. The food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up. After dinner, the crew member assigned to me, a mirthful Frenchman, made my bed and I had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full English. The aircraft arrived on time and we left with a minimum of fuss. The cabin was clean, the seats seemed new and the toilets, although small, were kept spotless. I could not fault anything before and during this flight."

British Airways staff at Delhi Airport were rude and unprofessional. I have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin baggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle. Another small camera pouch they consider as a separate bag. I was forced to give my cabin bag to my father in law and left with a normal handy bag with all stuff in it. Coming to the aircraft, food and staff - equally poor. Food was horrific, seats were torn, headphone socket not working, food tray was broken (I was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs) , tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches. Staff was not able to help at all. Nightmare experience."
974,C Bramill (United Kingdom) 25th November 2016,1/10,"""never be using BA again""","✅ Verified Review |  Marrakech to London Gatwick with British Airways. Baggage allowance is a joke. Doesn't matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff. Apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane. However, on boarding the plane there were people that had 3, or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours. These items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in. Other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken. When we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on. When contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight. Absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline. We will certainly never be using BA again."

Used the Executive lounge which is okay with a supply of snacks and drinks, it's also adjacent to the gate used by BA is pretty handy. Departed on time, seat 16B on another clean A320, crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flight. Flight time on the return a little longer 1hr 40 min due to congestion at LHR. Good service, I guess the only option not cheap, but would use again even if I had a choice."

Before purchase I called the British Airways service number on website and asked if I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK - was told 'yes but have to pay a £150 fee', and nothing else a little steep but OK. I further checked extra's would be against the Visa card used to purchase the ticket, 'of course' was the reply. BA make you pay to book a specific seat now. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of £1000+. I decline this option and explain the £150 as advised (actually APP says change cost is £0). Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost - hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market - however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in Abuja (during bank open hours) - some 6 hours and 300Km's away. By now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this up with BA complaints - takes 2 month to elicit a first response - to be dealt with on one sided website. They do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone, will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights. My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier. Never again."

Has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to Spain? According to a British Airways gate agent at Barcelona Airport, I supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave Spain. I drove across the border from the States to meet a friend in Canada and flew out from Vancouver on the same day to London for a week, and then from London to Spain for two weeks. All along the way of going through customs of Canada, UK, and Spain, I was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when I was leaving Spain. All of a sudden, this gate agent asked me “where are you going?  Where do you live?  Are you traveling alone?” I thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me “you have to wait here, I need to talk to someone.” There were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why I cannot get on the airplane.  I am a permanent resident of US; however, I am a citizen of the country participates in Visa Waver Program, which means I don’t need visa to enter Spain and definitely not when I leave. So, what’s wrong!? My name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my US Permanent Resident Card does not match with my passport. Of course, I just got married so that I have different last name from my passport, but even that, what kind of right does she have to ask me for my US Permanent Resident Card and stop me at the gate like that?! So, when she asked me if I have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name, I jokingly answered “marriage certificate??” Next thing I know was I cannot get on the airplane because I didn’t have marriage certificate with me, and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone, she said to me ""you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you.""

Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. Having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380. We were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. From the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn't hear it. This went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was ""normal"" on all their A380 aircraft. The food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. I chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. The food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the ""breakfast"" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. The standards have dropped so far it is incredible. I'm certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn't be issued with ear plugs. I'm booked to Miami once more in early 2017, fortunately on a quiet 747 and after that I will no longer fly with BA."

987,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 13th November 2016,9/10,"""another underwhelming experience""","✅ Verified Review |  The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a child I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of the plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old. Given the competition on this route you would think BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had to walk miles. Another underwhelming experience with BA. I wonder what those who spent £3,000.00 one way thought."
988,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 12th November 2016,3/10,"""underwhelming due to bean counters""","✅ Verified Review |  The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. I have reviewed this in the lounge section. The situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. Apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. Not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served, the entire full cabin of 17 - by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options (747/787/747). Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this cost. Wow, a £3 saving on a £3,00o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm, as is often the case. Lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup (do they offer anything else or am I unlucky) and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea - sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. Landed without being stacked for a change. As one comes to expect with BA, underwhelming due to the bean counters at LHR cutting back - as well as increasing fares. I'd like to see the entire BA board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier."
989,R Gordon (United Kingdom) 11th November 2016,3/10,"""bit amateur for business class ""","Gatwick to Alicante. Crew friendly but a bit amateur for business class Club Europe cabin. Upon boarding I found my row of seats dirty with lollipop stick, empty hankie wrappers, newspaper and empty water bottle all strewn across seat. Aircraft had sat at gate for an hour since landing from Glasgow, why isn't it cleaned and why don't the crew check the state of the business cabin at the very least? Pilot came on the tannoy and said because there were meals being served we had to wait for 6-7 more to be delivered. This delayed the departure by 20 minutes. More afternoon teas were carried on (and crockery). Cue lots of banging and clattering in the forward galley. Crew only offered a drink once which I thought was poor for a business cabin. Not very proactive. Call bell went unanswered twice. I asked for a Baileys and ice to round off the meal when I managed to catch the attention of purser. As duty free trolley rolled back I was handed two bags of nuts instead by another CC. Gave up at that point."
990,Martin Roper (United Kingdom) 7th November 2016,5/10,"""nothing short of a joke""","✅ Verified Review |  First time using British Airways as always flown Virgin but routes from Orlando to Gatwick were full with Virgin. The flight was cancelled with no reason for 24 hours. No apologies, a text message sent to my phone 4 hours before departure with no telephone or contact number. After an hour of ringing everybody I could at BA I ended up being passed to an offshore call centre. If you deal with BA this will be where you call for everything - cut off three times and completely incoherent. I was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in ""Club World"" seating. The plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable, it was in a dire state. My daughter commented ""this is like a dustbin with wings daddy"" when we got into the cabin. On arrival to my ""Club World"" bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere. I handed it to a stewardess who said ""that bit isn't important"" whilst looking down at me and taking it away. The inflight system was a joke, the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything. All the pixels were broken. The charging for laptops etc was US only and the remote for the entertainment system didn't work. An announcement came on before we left ""we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy. Please do not eat any nuts at anytime"". Once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut! I am proud to be British, but I am incredibly embarrassed for British Airways to represent my country in such a poor way. Fly with anybody other than BA. Trust me, they are nothing short of a joke."
991,James Allen (United Kingdom) 7th November 2016,2/10,"""Cabin looked worn and dated""","Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Cabin looked worn and dated. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Disappointed with lack of snack with bar service, in fact I previously flew in June and the airline always provided a fully stocked 'help yourself' tuck box. Inflight meals a disappointment compared with other airlines. Inflight entertainment satisfactory. I have had better inflight experiences with other non direct airlines on this route."
992,R Tompkins (United Kingdom) 7th November 2016,6/10,"""not worth a premium""","London to Geneva. I'm not sure British Airways are committed to short haul business anymore and can see them going high density economy seating only as some others do. Business seat same as economy everyone now knows about, but the downgraded food - lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham, slice of Palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll. And that was that. Not even butter with the roll. Guess the value of food was about GBP1. Crew did their best with a poor product. Flight on time. Not worth a premium over economy ticket."
993,Chris Rawson (United Kingdom) 6th November 2016,4/10,"""cabin crew were excellent in every way""","It does seem that many of the negative reviews of British Airways come from passengers travelling First or Business class. My wife and I flew from Heathrow to Los Angeles and found the entire experience extremely good. Boarding was efficient, the seats were comfortable and the leg room more than adequate. IFE was very good. The food was, well, it was airline food and you cannot expect haute cuisine at 38,000 ft. It was tasty enough, and there was some decent red wine. The cabin crew were excellent in every way, both friendly and efficient. Would I recommend BA to a friend? Yes, without question."
994,Chris Matthews (United Kingdom) 5th November 2016,9/10,"""we had been downgraded""","✅ Verified Review |  We'd booked to fly Club World 4 months ago. Turned up at St Lucia to be told British Airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded : this is on a £1700 ticket. According to the duty manager, they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers. We were given £300 each travel vouchers as compensation, so it means we have to use British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus (premium economy). Seats were ok, but it's the standard Economy menu. Breakfast was a croissant which had come out of a fridge, and was disgusting."
995,S Hunt (United Kingdom) 5th November 2016,8/10,"""Will not use BA again""",Our flight from London to Boston was okay. Disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10. Annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. The return flight was different. Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency. We had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later. Staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight. Will not use BA again. Delta and Virgin flights offer much better service.

Joe Barry (United Kingdom) 4th November 2016",2/10,"""well worth the money""","London Gatwick to Valencia with British Airways. Boarding the flight at Gatwick was good, professional and orderly. Ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in was efficent. Onboard we got out of the gate and under way quickly. Seats were fine, plenty of leg room back in economy, although they seemed to be a little dirty when I sat down but I thought nothing more of it. During the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duties. All friendly and welcoming. Food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight like this totally understandable. Drinks were fine, got the normal selection: Coke, coffee, juices etc. On the return flight it was slightly different. They seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop. Disappointed in this as what I wanted to buy wasnt avaliable.But on this return flight the positives outweigh the negatives. Flight crew again amazing. All kind and welcoming like the first flight. Overall the flights were nice. Well worth the money. Definitely would fly with them again on short haul flights through europe."
997,Bram Vanderelst (United Kingdom) 4th November 2016,9/10,"""they started dropping the ball""","London to Seville via Madrid. If you want budget airline service but decent airline prices, look no further than British Airways. I used to fly a lot with BA for both business and pleasure. But lately they really started dropping the ball. In 2016 I had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours. But that is not the worst. Recently I booked a flight to Seville from London. After a few weeks this flight got cancelled. It took me 3 different operators to find a solution via Madrid on the same day. ('No I don't want to fly the next day!). But guess what, 1 month later my outbound to Madrid got cancelled as well. Again it took some time to find an alternative. Ultimately I had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 2.5 hours. Also I need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in Seville. After complaining to BA about this process, I expected to get some sort of compensation, after all I'm an esteemed Silver member (their words). But none of that. A few phone calls later I am stuck with an automated e-mail service replying to me that no compensation is possible. I didn't ask for any money or anything. All I asked for is to waive the re-booking fee if I ever have to change a flight. This seemed only fair after BA cancels flights willy-nilly and doesn't take the customer into account. If this is the service extended to a Silver member, then I really don't want to know what they do to customers not part of their frequent flyer scheme."
998,Chris Malone (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2016,2/10,"""leg room was poor""","British Airways state that you can check in for free. When I checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight, there were only three seats available for the three of us. I also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in C or J. Due to online check in, I had only the option to select an aisle seat. At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is ""an embarrassment"". These are the words of a cabin crew member, not me. True - the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners. Cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen, only towards the start of the flight. Food was ok - veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse. However only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee. BA wake up - look to see what the competition is doing aircraft wise and sort out your unfair check in policy."

Leonard Miron (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2016",3/10,"""to fly to disappoint""","London Heathrow to Bucharest with British Airways. To fly to disappoint. After my arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for Club Europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the check-in lounge and a host was guiding you to the check-in line. After saying hello to the host making my way to the check-in line I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me, this is business class”. Like a naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the “exclusive area”. Check-in was smooth and I was airside in under 20 minutes. Enough time for some duty-free shopping in an airport already decorated for Christmas. Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light meals or snacks especially prepared for you” and “drink from our World Wine bar” as BA promised again on their website. The only  I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight”. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my “very British experience” the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn’t stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. And another odd element: no other drink service; you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the Club Europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley."
1000,P Hardiman (Belgium) 27th October 2016,5/10,"""don't make same mistake as me""","✅ Verified Review |  I am tall, 196cm to be exact. That's why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn't face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat. Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways ""Business"" class. What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  BA would not have been my choice anyway but I do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment. In that case don't make the same mistake as me. British Airways."
1001,E Mason (United Kingdom) 26th October 2016,1/10,"""embarrass flight staff so much""","✅ Verified Review |  Athens to Heathrow. I cannot believe that British Airways want to embarrass flight staff so much, as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served, which we were never warned about. We paid over £700 for our flight, two of us. It is so sad for loyal customers, if we wanted to go on Easyjet or Ryanair, we would, but to receive the same treatment is a great shame."
1002,K Jansen (Netherlands) 25th October 2016,3/10,"""excellent and friendly cabin crew""","✅ Verified Review |  Extremely chaotic check in at MLA, with no British Airways staff checking who is queuing where resulting in premium lane being filled with non C class / FF members. Security even more busy with Ryanair and Easyjet passengers going through priority/ fast track. Flight ok with warm food (chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes - also with mushroom!) and enough champagne to make one feel sleepy. Saying that if you have a mushroom allergy beware as there is no option to pre-order your meal online or over the phone for that specific allergy - BA should do something about this. Annoying passengers as per usual when using LGW - for me that's a holiday airport with people who don't fly often yet they claim to be the Alfa and omega of flying (to the point that we were told off by people behind us for reclining our seats and I quote ""obviously you don't fly much"" - us being silver with BA and gold with LH...). Landed ahead of schedule but ended up waiting for bags until all were offloaded despite having a priority tag on them. Excellent and friendly cabin crew."

Kim Thomsen (United Kingdom) 24th October 2016",6/10,"""very friendly but not attentive""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Bangkok to London Heathrow. Once again the 3 cabin B777. Crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so I never got a welcome drink. The seat was the standard Club World seat which is ok for lying down or sitting full up right, anything in between feel awkward. The food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition. As always BA's lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing (the Club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems). However the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight. The inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall. Pre-landing snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about. Crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings. If I had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price I would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided. British Airways needs to step up their game to get my money again."
1004,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 24th October 2016,3/10,"""another less than satisfactory experience""","✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick - Pisa Return. Another less than satisfactory experience with British Airways. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. When I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience. Now, as a cost cutting exercise - you don't. Which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. It was fine. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last time we used it. Plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. I settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. On the return the ""Club Europe"" lines at Pisa check in were used by just about anyone. It was a zoo. The BA airport crew didn't care and given the management at BA don't care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of Chicken dish. We got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. On both flights I got the front row which gave more legroom. The seats? Well the usual abysmal so called ""Club Europe."" A disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale. FAs in both directions were splendid. They get very embarrassed about talking about BA cutbacks. Who wouldn't? Flying 1st class next week to the Middle East. Not holding my breath that it is going to be an eye popping experience."

Also the in-flight entertainment screen did not work. On arrival in UK complained to British Airways but got a somewhat stock reply apologising and received a derisory £20 e-voucher as compensation. When flew back to Thailand (Flight No BA009 27 Sep) at check-in member of staff advised he was unable to print of boarding pass for onward flight Bangkok to Chiangmai but assured me this was quite normal and would cause no problems. With luggage booked through to final destination I was advised by Bangkok airport that, without the second boarding pass, I would have to go landside to check in at Bangkok Airways domestic check-in.

I was extremely disappointed with the onboard catering. For a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food. The tuck box vanished from your offering. We got served a small breakfast at departure (9am Tokyo time) and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. Pretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed.  It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levels. Perhaps the CEO could try out this sector in World Traveller or World Traveller Plus (rather the the First class he probably uses on a long haul flight) and see how he feels at the end of it! Maybe he will turn a little skinnier! Certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience!"

Andrew Evans (United Kingdom) 23rd October 2016",1/10,"""had a perfectly satisfactory flight""","✅ Verified Review |  I had a perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways to Boston and back this month (Oct 2016). I slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol. The only reason I fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and I dislike the club seating arrangement. Apart from breakfast scrambled eggs I hardly eat on long haul. Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it's a bonus if you get some ex Concorde crew. I never want to board the aircraft early as I know that I will not have trouble stowing my bags in first. A previous review complained that on the 787 there is only one toilet in first but there are only 8 seats. All in all, I use BA because from the UK I can get to any part of the world quickly with few changes and in safety."
1009,R Wood (United Kingdom) 22nd October 2016,8/10,"""listening to cabin crew moaning""","✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Manchester via Heathrow. Marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey. A 2 year old A380, the seats were much nicer than the 777-200 outbound flight - seat 82a, I did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor (can't say if that's a good thing for BA or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first A380 flight). That's the positives out of the way. No sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gate. Cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding. 7pm departure so I was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as I could. At 9:30pm meal arrived, no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals. I got a bread roll she didn't, she got a dessert I didn't, neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty I had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a Diet Coke! Woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it. A folded omelette 2.5 potato wedges and a cherry tomato, (breakfast of kings). The final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long I had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives. The 20 minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing. My quick connecting flight to Manchester was pretty much the same too. If I could rate things as 0 stars I would. I'm ashamed British Airways is my national carrier."

Flew out on G-EUYY A320 and back on G-EUXF A321 both excellent flights, the crew were very smart and welcoming and the aircraft clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the lunch and bar service going out and refreshments and bar service on return.

I have been on many short haul flights that would have been far more comfortable let alone a 12 hour flight to Seoul. I am not overweight but I am 6ft-2ins tall and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there was absolutely no space remaining. The total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future.
1012,Martin Cerny (Czech Republic) 15th October 2016,7/10,"""breakfast was a bad joke""","Seattle to Prague via London Heathrow with British Airways. Check-in took about an hour (online checkin was not available). The catering onboard is the worst from all European legacy airlines. The breakfast on the long haul flight was a bad joke (bread with cheese and a muesli bar). On the 2 hour flight only little chips or biscuits. I talked to the cabin crew on most of the 4 flights, they encouraged me to write reviews, because they do not agree with the company catering policy too. Also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality. The aircrafts were new, that is of course more important that food."
1013,S Kendall (Australia) 13th October 2016,1/10,"""worst long-haul experience""","Singapore to Heathrow. British Airways gave me something I wasn't expecting - probably my worst long-haul flight experience ever. Clearly BA's cost-cutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine 'cattle-class' experience. They really need to up their game to compete with Singapore Airlines and Emirates - who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. BA - where do I start? Cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. That feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. The entertainment system just about kept the children entertained - but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack, quality 'kids' treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.If you have a choice go with another airline. Go with Emirates."
1014,Sarah Shailes (United Kingdom) 12th October 2016,2/10,"""yet another abysmal flight""","✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Budapest with British Airways. Yet another abysmal flight with BA. The majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups. Perhaps that's why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight. The cheaper no checked baggage tickets, allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage, cause chaos on boarding, with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers. Consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place. All semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned, there is no welcome on board, only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage. The seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable. Cabin so called service, was nonexistant. The packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse, and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea. The cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through ""meal"" service to maximise time available to chat in the galley. The one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time, and arrived 10 minutes early. I was only on the flight as part of a tour group. Booking independently, I would have opted for a rival low cost carrier."
1015,Charles Berger (United States) 11th October 2016,1/10,"""they are unreliable ""","✅ Verified Review |  Washington Dulles to Nairobi via London. Was excited to fly First Class on BA from Dulles to Nairobi, since it's about 15 hours of flying time I decided to splurge on a 1st Class ticket. Things started off poorly at checkin when BA's computer system went down  a seemingly constant problem ) . After 45 minutes of waiting, they were finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Here's where BA's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA. We chose Kenya Airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. No, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger. The bottom line is, don't fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligible. If you're just flying on to the Continent where there are multiple flights you may make it."
1016,R Nelson (United Kingdom) 11th October 2016,4/10,"""not customer focussed in any way whatsoever""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew Malaga to Gatwick. Although a better flight than two weeks ago the 'service' of a small packet of crisps, peanuts or biscuit is a disgrace. At least with other airlines you can purchase food. Passengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering. For our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of 'To fly-to serve'. We will choose any other airline over British Airways in future - human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the BA management (although the cabin staff did their very best). No doubt BA management can't wait to get their hands on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge. Truly shocking values and not customer focussed in any way whatsoever."
1017,Penelope Knollys (United Kingdom) 10th October 2016,1/10,"""how disappointed we were""","We were very excited about our Club World journey to Mauritius and how disappointed we were. The food wasn't great, the wines weren't either and the foot part of my ""flat bed"" kept on collapsing so I hardly got any sleep. The cabin staff were good and very helpful. We have travelled Virgin Upper Class and it is much better as your bed is made up with a duvet and sheets. All we got on British Airways was a sort of rather nasty blanket and no sleep suit either. Very disappointed in all of it. Our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to Gatwick was struck by lightening which is not BA's fault I know but I would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past. Maybe they just don't have spare planes any more long haul. We have travelled British Airways Europe several times in the past 3 years and think this is wonderful but long haul just does not do it for us and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we won't have to travel British Airways unless they pull up their socks."

Outward journey seating was basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink. Return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps. I think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshments being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flights. Staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on British Airways.
1019,N Rempe (Canada) 10th October 2016,5/10,"""avoid British Airways at all costs""","We recently flew British Airways business class from Calgary to Rome via London and returned the same route. Like previous reviews we too will avoid British Airways at all costs. Although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal! Who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet?  Even worse is what British Airways sells as business class within Europe. They are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. Could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! They are the only international carrier that does this. Even in business class. When I logged on 24 hours in advance, there were no seats to choose from - and to my utter surprise my husband and I weren't even seated together. Shame on you British Airways for being so cheap! We are flying to Europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere! On the plus side, food and service on our flights was exceptional but your customer service leaves much to be desired."

The choice of seats (free of charge) was very poor, even the plane was half-full. The check-in (baggage) organization in JFK was a mess. Long lines with no priority for members. You should arrive min 2hours before the boarding, otherwise you will miss your flight.  The staff in the plane more less accabtable. My hand luggage got misplaced in the plane, I think somebody just remove it. I asked the staff, and at least they found my hand luggage. Recommendation to BA, staff behaved partly unacceptable. Beverages and seat comfort in total okay."

Flew from Johannesburg to London Heathrow. The seating in business on the A380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels as if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate. The staff were just about acceptable, but they appeared indifferent and just going through the motions of serving the food and beverages whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job. Oh, and my TV packed up and froze, so I was unable to watch or listen to any music for half of the journey. The Qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the A380. Shame they don't fly to South Africa, although, if they did, it would be impossible to book a seat, as everyone would choose to fly with them and not British Airways."

My husband and I were flying to Mauritius for our second anniversary from Gatwick Airport. The staff were rude and inattentive. I pressed the flight attendant button so many times, and after waiting 20 mins, they just switched it off. However, that was not the worst of it - the flight was so cold. We asked if they could please turn it up (they didn't care), multiple passengers asked for extra blankets (not that it would help). I was literally shaking the whole flight through, even though I had multiple layers of clothes on. I will never fly direct to Mauritius with British Airways. I paid more for a direct ticket, than a indirect flight, but thanks BA for letting me realise paying more doesn't equate to better service."
1024,Michael Shortland (Thailand) 30th September 2016,2/10,"""a mistake to choose BA""","✅ Verified Review |  Paris to Bangkok via London. What a mistake to choose BA for this business class flight. The experience of the seats (with their weird coffin-like configuration, sliding screens, and people climbing over me almost continually) was enough to say ""never again"". The service was very patchy, with some decidedly long-faced and size-challenged cabin staff. Coffee undrinkable, and forget having a choice. Main course near to inedible, but the portions were thankfully miniature. The wine selection was good, but my unsmiling stewardess told me there was no Bordeaux ""only merdock"". (I should have explained that Medoc is a Bordeaux region, but really). This simply comes nowhere close to Thai, Emirates or Cathay. Singapore Airlines is in a league way way ahead. I should add that the lounges in Paris and London were great. Paris was a share with Cathay, and London's Terminal 5 lounge was excellent. Shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating: tight, face to face with a complete stranger, noisy and hard."
1025,F Glencross (United Kingdom) 30th September 2016,3/10,"""unlikely we will ever fly with them again""","Absolutely dire. They were installing a new check in system which failed. Huge queues at check in and we had to ask to be taken out of the line or we would have missed our flight despite arriving well in advance. They then lost our luggage, both mine and my partners, and they didn't even get it on the Glasgow flight. The luggage took 2 days to arrive in Zurich, that's 2 days from a 6 day break that we had to stay in waiting on luggage. Their online information service didnt match what we were told verbally on the phone and the people we spoke to were irritable, rude and unhelpful. We submitted a formal complaint on our return via BA website. It took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in London. Totally irrelevant to the problems in Glasgow. An appalling company and gone are the days where they had a good reputation for looking after customers. Unlikely we will ever fly with them again unless there is absolutely no other option."
1026,Gregory Burton (United Kingdom) 30th September 2016,1/10,"""not fit for purpose""","✅ Verified Review | Here I am again after my previous review 2 weeks ago of specifically the British Airways online check in system. I am currently in Cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to London this evening with my elderly Mother. We sat next to each other last night at 1930 and opened our BA apps on our phones at the same time. My Mother had a choice of 12 seats (on a 300 seat Boeing 767), and I had a choice of just 4 seats. Again. So clear evidence of passenger inequality at BA, even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class. This happened 2 weeks ago when flying from London Heathrow to Larnaca. Firstly, why do I, who flies several times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to ""choose"" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from? Secondly, why do BA offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets. As it should be with every airline. But BA appear to suffer from some kind of 'seat hoarding' issue for some reason. I presume they would rather people pay the £15 to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets, something I personally will never ever do."
1027,Colin Barry (Australia) 30th September 2016,2/10,"""provided a high quality service""",✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to London Heathrow with British Airways. The was our first experience on BA's A380 and it was very comfortable and relaxing. We usually fly Etihad from Australia to LHR but this time decided to try BA. The boarding at Singapore was efficient friendly and on time. As this was a late evening flight (2320) we just wanted to get settled and into bed as soon as possible. We made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the beds. The config of First Class in BA is 1-2-1 with 2 aisles. This is not as good as the Etihad First which has a central aisle with individual cabins (called apartments) of the aisle. Never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow. The staff were very professional and did not bother us until breakfast time. Breakfast was just ok with limited options but this was ok for us. The A380 is clearly the benchmark in long haul First Class flight and on this occasion BA provided a high quality service.

The seats were uncomfortable. The plane was old and the tv screens were scratched and appalling to watch. There were 2 drinks services the whole 10 hour flight, not including the 2 meals which were worse than usual. We couldn't get up and walk about as the seatbelt sign was on for extended periods. I didn't think there was much turbulence, I've had worse. The crew disappeared for extended periods of time. British Airways are obviously running on the cheap whilst trading on its previous good reputation. This is unacceptable. Compared to the Dreamliner which also has games, USB charging ports, new films and drinks on demand - this is vastly inferior and I will never travel BA again."
1029,K Thomsen (United Kingdom) 29th September 2016,5/10,"""expectations low and still disappointed""","Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Fast check-in by friendly staff at LHR. The Galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through L2. Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point. Based on reviews here I had set my expectations of BA low and I was still disappointed."

They do have a stuffiness and it irritates that we need to pay for selecting any seats, even if we fly Business class. This is something that I and every sensible person, would consider as utter madness. I did not pay a penny and managed to get an aisle seat for my AUH-LHR leg on my trip. Boarding was chaotic although this is nothing to do with BA but its the airport mess. Staff were polite and efficient and we landed ahead of time. On departure we were given a light snack and before arrival a full English breakfast. Overall a comfortable flight."

Cabin interior is tired and the media screen was tiny. Food was ok but we had one beer and were then told there was no beer left on the plane! Asked three flight attendants for a drink later in the flight but only one attendant bothered to return - and that was to say there were no drinks left. Service on the return flight was no better. I am planning a business class trip to Thailand in November and I note the Emirates price is £550.00 less than BA. The British Airways plane is again a Boeing 777-200, which are now old and outdated and the Emirates are all A380 or 777-300ER, less than 5 years old with the most up to date entertainment and excellent in flight service. And they send a chauffeur driven car to take you to the airport! - why would anyone fly BA if they had a choice?"

Departed and landed on time - I was actually en route to Botswana so time to connect with that flight. Return leg was not full, seat upstairs and it seemed quieter. No passenger in window seat so I had aisle and window to myself but the arm rest between the seats only goes up half way - seems a BA design feature and is annoying. This crew seemed to be in a race to complete the dinner service - again chicken and rice (5 days after outward trip) and not as well prepared. The cabin crew were trying to serve coffee in the middle of the meal in order to disappear as fast as possible. They reappeared at breakfast, which was the BA version of a ""full English"" as it was on the outward trip - something yellow which pretended to be egg, but the rest was OK. Landed on time. Cabin crew seemed younger than usual and maybe they needed a senior to point out to them that hurrying the serving of meals is too obvious and not what we pay for."
1033,Mark Dixon (United Arab Emirates) 22nd September 2016,5/10,"""one of the worst flight/travel experiences""","✅ Verified Review |  Abu Dhabi to Heathrow return. Probably one of the worst flight/travel experiences me and my family have had to endure! From what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the UK to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly British Airways again. First when checking in in Abu Dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new Boeing 787. Of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. Passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on, eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in. The actual flight time was 14:00, then the plane was delayed yet again. British Airways staff were no where to be found! Eventually a supposed British Airways manager arrived. We then couldn't check in because the system was broken, after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in Uni.! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. Then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for Uni was missing, apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. Again no communication from British Airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. Sad thing is that in the move to Uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag, when we explained this to the BA phone operator, she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. Thank you BA for the great advice. Now sitting on the plane returning to home to Abu Dhabi (same plane) 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine. Great you found the leak! But a new plane all these problems! Seriously British Airways, should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world."

Aircraft in poor state of preparation with stains on back of seat leather and generally dirty. Pushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle. 40 minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that lead to CSD threatening to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved. Well dealt with by cabin staff. Very noisy group of males on golf holiday in seats to rear of row 21 who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language - spoken to by other passengers and told to desist. The food just gets worse each trip I fly with them - muesli high in sugars and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard - is this really the best they can do? Finally to round off flight, a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flights I have ever taken with BA . Cabin staff great but product is poor."

These, and a drink in a small plastic cup were served with no finesse; possibly the cabin crew were embarrassed by the lack of anything more substantial. British Airways need to decide whether to improve food offered on short haul flights, or to have reasonably priced good quality snack available as do their low cost competitors."

Flew from London Heathrow to Seattle. Poor boarding procedure at T5 with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on, passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not. Econ seemed about 75% full. Sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about 3 hours of taking off. Cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures, saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers. Travelling with 3 children who didn't like the only option offered, so much frustration with British Airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price. Complained to Customer Service after arriving home and was told the caterer at LHR was to blame and they didn't want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals. Seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said. Crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated. Hard to recommend BA but given the competition on this route, and the desire to stay with One World/BA FFP, it's a poor choice."

It seems British Airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that it's turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices. I only fly with them now when tour operators give me no choice. Ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths, refusing to change my seat because ""that's what the computer has allocated"". Boarding was the now expected shambles. The no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premium. On this flight several were removed from lockers, and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front, thus severely restricting leg room. Cabin staff were rude and uncaring. Again now the norm for BA. The in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea. The seats are very narrow, allowing minimal room a no space between neighbouring passengers."

British Airways flight BA632 from LHR to Athens on 11th September was by far the worst cabin crew that I have encountered in 45 years of flying. The crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in Business Class, and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area. After 1.5 hours in the air, we were offered a drink, the champagne was undrinkable, and the crew gave me a gin and tonic. After that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible. That was all the service we received on the whole flight of 3.5 hours. No top up of drinks no offer of water, and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking.

I went into the British Airways app on my phone 20 seconds after online check-in opened, and totally disappointed to see only 4 seats available to choose from. This is the second time this has happened with British Airways in the last few months, who really should not be offering an online check-in service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection! I called them to enquire why they do this, to which the reply was that most seats are ""restricted"" on online check-in. They did sort the seat I wanted however as I'm flying with my Mother who obviously I want to be sat next to. Yet when I looked yesterday at the option of paying £15 for a seat reservation before online check-in opens, there was a good choice available. If British Airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat, and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying, then they should abolish the online check-in as it's clearly not providing the service it should do - Online check-in means being able to choose from several seats, not being unacceptably limited to 4 seat choices only, just 20 seconds after online check-in has opened!"

Lounge in Dubrovnik is OK but refreshments poor, but better than being in the busy main departures area. The in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing. No priority boarding. Cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay! No newspapers available, when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing BA could provide them in the premium cabin. So called 'Brunch' was served, which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato, lettuce leaf and cucumber. Very poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flight. This to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how BA expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets. Cabin crew did nothing to stop economy passengers coming through to use the toilet in business, is it that difficult? Very poor show and think we will look at alternatives next time!"
1042,S Simpson (United Kingdom) 14th September 2016,4/10,"""First Class is average at best""","✅ Verified Review |  Took a domestic flight from Knoxville to Atlanta for onward British Airways flight to Heathrow. Went to BA to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so I needed to resolve it with my travel agent. Check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude. Finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. Lounge in Atlanta was mediocre at best. Flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren't anything special. I'd say BA First Class is average at best when compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines. My baggage didn't arrive at Heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with BA lost baggage - it was finally delivered almost a week later. Overall, not the kind of service that you would expect when flying First Class. Raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks (and four follow up calls to customer relations), who said that since my agent had booked my Knoxville flight that was due to land in Atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to Heathrow, their system ""automatically took my booking off"" - I don't know whether this is normal but I've never come across this issue before in all my years of flying. Absolutely awful customer service. BA have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isn't good enough, not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins, which is atrocious. Needless to say, won't be flying with them again if I can help it."

Very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for BA 31 service to HKG on September 10th. I was buying my ticket in April, so early. As BA Executive Club Gold member I had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type, 51D on upper deck at time of buying the ticket. In AMS, when checking in for that flight, this seat was still granted, 2.5 hours later at gate I was reallocated to 14G on main deck. First no explanation, then that they ""could make a family happy to sit together"", but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not. No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits? Especially concerning their reservation policy, that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together! The flight itself was, aside from odor and noise, uneventful, the cabin crew very pleasant."

Seat comfortable, pitch on the small side. Business class bus transport to LHR terminal 5 main building."

Joao Da Costa (United Kingdom) 14th September 2016",8/10,"""service does not meet standards""",✅ Verified Review |  Porto to London. Third time flying on this route with BA and always boarding with a minimal delay of 1 hour. Poor snacks on board despite comfortable and pleasant flight. BA recently started this route some months ago with low cost flights but the service does not meet the standards that should be expected for a company with its dimensions.
1048,J Spencer (United Kingdom) 11th September 2016,4/10,"""gradually declined in quality""","Naples to London Gatwick. The aircraft was fairly new (which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes we've flown on with BA). We'll ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint: having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane. As we didn't land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. We were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts! We complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of August. What a disgrace. We regularly fly BA and are silver card holders, however, we've decided to fly our next two long haul flights with Emirates. The BA planes we've flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality. What other airline expects you to climb over a strangers legs or to have a stranger climb over your legs to gain access to the aisle? You can't keep waking people up and have no alternative but to ungracefully climb out! The older I get, the harder this is becoming."

The flights were on time, crew on board were polite and helpful, the captain kept us informed on both the outward and return flights. The cabin and toilets were clean. Porto airport was well run and efficient, Gatwick which had filthy toilets was not such a pleasant experience."

I'm trying to research whether this is just the Phoenix route but this plane was ancient. The business class seats are dirty and ripped, the entertainment system is terrible and the lounge for first and business customers is embarrassing. BA are the only airline to fly to Phoenix direct from LHR, but they need a serious rethink about the poor standards and condition of this plane. Next time I will fly a different airline and transfer via Chicago or Dallas."
1052,T Bowman (United Kingdom) 29th August 2016,3/10,"""charges for baggage are outrageous""","✅ Verified Review |  Lisbon to Heathrow on British Airways. I booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flight. The travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance. I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to London. At Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. The departure board did not show the check-in area for the BA flights. I had to find my own way to where BA check-in. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. When other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful. The departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. The cabin crew were very professional. The departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. My seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. Arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags. When things go well, BA is excellent. However, charges for baggage are outrageous and place BA in the same category as budget airlines. I give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabin-crew though."
1053,Shah Noor (United Kingdom) 29th August 2016,6/10,"""was like a no frills airline""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech with my family for a 7 day holiday. First timer on British Airways. Pros: Flight on time Comfortable seats, generous luggage allowance. Easy online check-in 24 hrs before. Pleasant flight. Con: Meal - I thought they would provide proper hot meals i.e. rice and curry. however, route London to Marrakech (and vice versa) only one type of cold meal, sandwich is served. Also small chocolate dessert, biscuit and the usual tea, coffee or drink is provided. Unfortunately I could not have the meal as I do not eat anything with added sugar. Toilets - Only saw 2 toilets which was rather over used and busy. Entertainment/TV - none. I expected seats to be built-in with TVs so that kids could be busy and entertained. This was like a no frills airline. Thankfully kids had their tablets with them. Staff - Okay, but could be bit more friendly and approachable. A smile would make the difference. Return flight - Airplane was bit dirty. I noticed crips bags tucked under the chair. Overall a 3 star airline in my opinion."

1055,Rita Farren (United Kingdom) 27th August 2016,7/10,"""no longer lives up to expectations""",Heathrow to Belfast with British Airways. Boarded about 12 noon for 12.55 take off. After some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called. We were offered water or soft drinks initially. We finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. It was quite disgraceful for BA. Once airborne we were served tea / coffee / alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. Is this what BA has been reduced to? This airline definitely no longer lives up to expectations and I will not be flying with them again. At least with low cost airlines you can at least buy some food.
1056,K Simpson (United Kingdom) 26th August 2016,2/10,"""doesn't cut the mustard any longer""","✅ Verified Review |  
I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?"
1057,K Haymes (Germany) 24th August 2016,5/10,"""no longer competes on service""","✅ Verified Review | Berlin TXL to London Heathrow with British Airways. After purchasing ticket I could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status. I called BA 3 times. The first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system. After the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be made. At check-in I spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junk-fee for a single piece of luggage. Again I had to call BA 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight. 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk-fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound. The second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk-fee. The third call was to complain about spending 2-hours checking in and correcting BA's mistakes. I spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee. The BA lounge at TXL is small and does not have a toilet. There were no warm food items on offer. I did find the service to be good. Boarding commenced at the farthest point at Berlin Tegel from the BA Lounge. Flight was okay with minimal amenities. BA not only does not compete on price but amazingly, no longer competes on service."

I fly the route regularly and I have noticed decline in the BA level of service. Boarding in Warsaw is chaotic. No priority boarding rules enforced (basically boarding started for everone at the same time, no matter you fly premium or are a frequent flyer). New BA short haul seats are  not really comfortable (fine for 1h flight but get uncomfortable for any longer). Same concerns meals provided. Crisps and drinks with no possibility of buying further food is not enough for 2.5h flight. I would rather cut on free alcohol and have a decent sandwich or a possiblity to buy further food if necessary. On the plus side, cabin service very well trained and attentive. The WAW to LON route is served with other carriers (including budget ones) and I will have hard time justify paying a premium to fly BA on this route in the future."

We were bumped off a BA connecting flight from Manchester to London Heathrow and put on an American Airlines B777-300 via LHR. Whilst I would agree that the staff on AA see passengers as a necessary evil (particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy), the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging BA B747 aircraft. The food / drink served on the AA flight was also better than that served with BA. At least the coffee on AA came in coffee shop style cups, not the feeble paper cups that BA provided, with its 2 sips and it's gone drinks. I'm going to be booking a trip for our anniversary early next year to Boston, which I think I'll book with Icelandair, as this would avoid the 20 mins taxiing to the runway and 20 minutes circling time that."
1060,B Richardson (United Kingdom) 14th August 2016,5/10,"""friendly and professional""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at Heathrow. The departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. However the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. Once on board I found the cabin to be very clean. Unlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. However the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system provided is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. This option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. The service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. Arrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficient. The return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleep. Unfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration. A marked contrast to the experience at YVR."
1061,W Jackson (United States) 14th August 2016,8/10,"""A380 is unconscionably crammed""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Washington DC. The Business Class Cabin on a British Airways A380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per row. Most other international carriers I've flown limit themselves to no more than four, or, at most, five seats per row in Business Class. In the BA configuration, passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed. Also, the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes, and the seats are claustrophobically narrow. By far the worst Business Class seats I've ever encountered."
1062,R Anderson (United Kingdom) 14th August 2016,5/10,"""no respect for economy travellers""","✅ Verified Review |  I fly this route 3-4 times a year, unfortunately there is no competition other than Air Canada. I've had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfied. On this last flight a week ago, the plane has been internally reconfigured, and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 1/3 of the space, and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normal-sized adult. I have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - I offered to send BA this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint, see below. The discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours - for which I did not blame the airline - meaning I spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. Then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre-landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar, approximately 2 inches in size. As a result I arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would have brought food on the flight had I known of the miserly cost-cutting measure in advance. I wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration, as this can't easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. I ended my complaint saying I had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers. I've just received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint, indicating that it was not even read, and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy. Which is particularly shortsighted, as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances, and we won't forget how we were treated."

Unfortunately due to renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn't as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I'm sure that standard will be resumed. On boarding it was nice to be ""welcomed back"", a small but nice touch. Straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks, warm towels and our menu choices. BA does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic. One of the things I really love about BA is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew. The more ""senior members"" really do know their stuff - the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception. Superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service. The only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the IFE which really does need an update. I know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft. As an aviation enthusiast, a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight. BA! My airline of choice"

British Airways have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal tray Club Europe! The seats were narrow and uncomfortable economy seats. The flight attendant was grumpy, rude, and sullen. I accept this was a short flight, but how British Airways get away with calling this Business Class is beyond me. They should be cited for trade descriptions. I wonder if any BA senior executives bother to fly their so-called Premium Classes?"

It would have been fine had I not paid top dollar for all the amenities. I submitted a complaint and asked for a partial $$$ voucher but to no avail. The customer service personnel told me things in conflict to documented conversations. The final straw was when I contacted my travel agent and had them call BA on my behalf. BA told them they would not refund anything because it was a voluntary upgrade. Really? BA changed my flight and rerouted me with less amenities.  What is so irrating is the cost was over $4,000 for each ticket and I was not provided the service or flight I paid for. False advertising."

BA denied me boarding because their system required not only me, but also the cello seat needs to have an ESTA visa! They were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system. After 3 hours of stress at check-in they denied me boarding and quoted me over $4,000 to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journey.

1071,Richard Welfare (United Kingdom) 23rd July 2016,10/10,"""service was variable""","Bengaluru to London Heathrow with British Airways in World Traveller. Started badly - at check-in and gate boarding World Traveller passnegers are made to feel second-class citizens, but this seemed worse at Bengaluru (choatic) than Heathrow. The plane itself was packed to capacity, probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. I had chosen an aisle seat in the centre (seat 38D) at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. Leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. Seat width is OK. The adjustable headrest is better than that in Premium Economy (World Traveller Plus) although the seat base is hard. For a 10 hour flight I recommend sitting on the cushion. Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. To be expected to put up with a seat without VOD for 10 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast after 2hrs, in then a snack box after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately, while I thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first, that was not the case, and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone. No connectivity in seat, only earphone socket. VOD choice quite limited compared to other airlines. Unfortunately I think that British Airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the Middle and Far Eastern carriers in future."

British Airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade, as they advise their responsibility is to get us from A to B. The entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price. Even though looking at their website they state ""personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones"" as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy. The fact that we did not even get to watch the security video is not a concern to BA. As someone who flies BA a lot, they have just lost a customer and do not care. I would avoid flying BA now.

Even less legroom than on a local flight to Europe (Ryanair) on a 10 hour flight. On the return journey the first flight from San Francisco to Heathrow was delayed. Once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy. So they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were. Very scary in view of the security situation. Then our row of 3 seats had no in-flight entertainment (row 28) The first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it. Then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink. So we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment. On landing at Heathrow our next flight to Aberdeen was also delayed for one hour. On complaining to BA they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds. Not much use if you intend never to fly BA again. Shocking customer service. Avoid Heathrow and particularly BA at Heathrow.

It was definitely not worth it. The 777 has smaller first class seats, they have expanded the number of seats, too. There are now around 20. Cabin crew were young and clearly without enough experience. Quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals - they have been ""taught"" to do everyone individually. That doesn't work when they have expanded the number of passengers. Cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. They disappeared after lunch for many hours - until it was time for tea. Which is now a meal less adequate than it used to be in Club. Further, First Class food is far from first class. Fewer choices, and what is provided is not good. Very disappointing. First Class in BA used to be restful and the food was decent."

The seat was the new First with upgraded Panasonic entertainment system, I was addressed by name throughout the flight, given extra food to try as it was a half full cabin, regular top ups for drinks, and received a stellar service from a dedicated and professional crew.

1081,B H Wilcox (United Kingdom) 8th July 2016,4/10,"""Business class beware""","Refusing to pay £73 pp to reserve seats in Business Class (a stunt more worthy of Ryanair) I checked in two passengers online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row 7 and the other in row 11. There was no option to change seats and no phone contact given. I tried to phone the British Airways Kuala Lumpur office but the number given would not connect. I then went to the BA Office listed in Kuala Lumpur only to find it had been closed and moved to another location in Ampang Park. Still having asked several people no one knew of a BA office. Arriving at the airport I was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board, which proved to be the case. But I then found myself next to a family with three very small children. Although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight. It was a long night and a very difficult flight. The sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what I expected in business class. All in all it was a flight in flying nursery which I would rather forget. I now know why other reviewers on this site have used the acronym BA - Better Avoid. Business class beware."
1082,Justin Brooks (Switzerland) 8th July 2016,2/10,"""business configuration is far from personal""","Having flown on an Emirates and Thai A380 I had high hopes for a great experience on British Airways. Not so. The lounge in Johannesburg was packed and the space in general was claustrophobic. Onboard I am used to personalised greetings and warm smiles with a glass or two of fine champagne within minutes of arriving. It took BA cabin crew until the final seconds of boarding to offer any drinks, and they certainly disappeared before a second drink could be requested. Business configuration is far from personal with someone sitting directly opposite you. Seats are extremely uncomfortable for what is business class. At meal time a member of cabin crew came and kicked closed a drawer that was part of my seat. No decorum at all. I have had better service on easyjet. Very difficult to sleep as the person adjacent to the seat in front of mine had to climb over my legs to get out into the aisle. Terrible. No way BA."

1084,Samuel Shehu (United Kingdom) 6th July 2016,9/10,"""appalling service received""","✅ Verified Review |  Absolute appalling service received by British Airways, I had a morning flight from Amsterdam to London which they cancelled for fog, the flight was for 10am and even though the weather was clear by 9.30 am, they refused to book me on another flight until 10pm - not even a meal was offered to me all that time. I was in the airport from 7am till 9pm, that is for over 14 hours, and was told it was weather and out of their hands, even though they had over 10 flights to London over the period. I was shocked by the treatment given the way I held the airline in high esteem, to the point that I have now refused to purchase any flight via them or related to them since that time even if the have the cheapest tickets and only direct route."
1085,P Sarkins (Australia) 2nd July 2016,2/10,"""lost my business forever""",✅ Verified Review |  Cannot believe how bad British Airways was. We arrived very early at the airport in Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight to London in premium economy. They would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. It is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers. British Airways has lost my business forever.
1086,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 1st July 2016,1/10,"""all in all not bad""","Zurich to London Heathrow with British Airways. The lounge at Zurich was fine. Reasonable selection of food and booze albeit a shared lounge. Given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why BA could not have a small personalised set up. But we are talking about BA where nothing is ""normal"". Flight was rammed. I doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full. The plane left 25 minutes late - but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way I could not care less. Seats, the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to BA regional business class. A lousy set up. FA's were very friendly and provided great customer service. I complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the Club Europe WCs. I am not a snob by any means - but given I paid about £450 - one way for the ticket, surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable. FAs were sympathetic and I filled out a complaint card. All in all not bad, apart from the miserable seat and not being able to get off the plane quickly."
1087,M Marshall (United Kingdom) 30th June 2016,8/10,"""perhaps BA are finally listening""","✅ Verified Review | First class flight from London Gatwick to St Lucia with British Airways. First lounge at Gatwick was being refurbished but there was a temp replacement lounge offered by No.1 which was actually superior to to the old BA one. Flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early which is always a pleasant surprise. The seats in first may not be quite as impressive as other airlines but they are still very comfortable and spacious. Inflight entertainment was very good with an excellent selection of movies. Two areas stood out on this flight - the first was the exceptional cabin crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearing. Most importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant one. The next one (and I cannot believe I am saying this) was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in CW and First. It might have been a fluke but having just flown back in Business from St Lucia, the service and food was just as good. Perhaps BA are finally listening to their customers!"

C Long (United Kingdom) 30th June 2016",8/10,"""didn't really pay attention""","✅ Verified Review |  
Flying in Club Europe from London City to Berlin Tegel, returning in economy with British Airways. The outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. The food offered in the CE cabin was delicious. Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. I had done my online check in on my return flight. Just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. The check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. She checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn't bother. When I was queuing up at the passport control, I noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had cleared through security. BA staff were shocked that I was checked in under someone else's name. Wrong name, Wrong flight etc. They asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY. They gave me a new luggage tag. After arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. I approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. I explained the situation which she didn't really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. Again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage."

Connecting from Heathrow to Amsterdam was a disaster. They board passagers onto the plane just for them to later find out that the plane was defect. The pilot and engineers tried fixing the problem and let us sit inside for 3 hours. Finally discovered that they couldn't fix it, took another 30 min to let us back out to the terminal for us to find solutions ourselves. No food after 7 hours of searching for a flight to Amsterdam. Got to Amsterdam and my luggage had never been loaded onto the plane."
1090,Christine Brallisford (United Kingdom) 18th June 2016,5/10,"""handled a difficult situation professionally""",Newcastle to Las Vegas via London Heathrow. Heathrow to Las Vegas there were 3 groups of men who were extremely loud and unruly - it was particularly challenging for the attendants. In my opinion they handled a difficult situation professionally. They were totally run ragged. These passengers were a total disgrace but well done to the BA staff - they did really well.
1091,Y Wong (United Kingdom) 18th June 2016,8/10,"""passing off economy seats as business""","✅ Verified Review |  We travelled on BA 633 from Athens on 12th of June, 2016. The flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. British Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. To be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  If we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy."
1092,Deborah Jones (Bermuda) 17th June 2016,2/10,"""service is simply terrible""","In April my husband and I had booked business class seats from Bermuda to London on British Airways. The flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next day in premium economy and to date, two months later, no refund or compensation. We are gold card members and fly to London business class about 12-14 times a year. The service from Customer Relations is absolutely unbelievable. Last September I had glass in my foot on a flight from Bermuda to London as a result of flight crew dropping drinking glasses and not cleaning up properly. No compensation. British Airways has the monopoly on flights from Bermuda to London and the service is simply terrible. What really bothers me is that no one cares from British Airways, and I have no idea of where to lodge a complaint."
1093,B Phelp (United Kingdom) 17th June 2016,2/10,"""customer service the worst going""","✅ Verified Review |  I think that British Airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going, but that is their only achievement. Having booked our flight from Alicante to Gatwick I immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of €23 each. When I came to check in online, 24 hours before the flight, I found that we had been moved to row 30, the very back of the plane. When I selected 'Change your Seat' row 4 was not even displayed. I am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. For this reason I am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not and have not received any notification from BA to tell me they had changed the seating. Nor have I received my money back. While waiting to board the plane I received a text message survey on my BA experience so far. I participated and gave a summary of the situation. I also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. When I got home I gave BA one day to contact me but when they did not I submitted a complaint through their website. After some days I got a reply saying: 'Would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? We’ll be more than happy to see if you’re eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight'. I cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. But with BA you have to 'claim' a refund and then wait while they 'check your eligibility'. My family take many flights each year including long hauls to Asia. Needless to say that none of these will ever be on British Airways."

C Collins (United Kingdom) 17th June 2016",2/10,"""staff friendly but professional""",✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to London Gatwick with British Airways. Excellent flight. Left more or less on time and even with the interminable taxing at JFK we still arrived on time at London Gatwick. Flight was very busy but the service didn't suffer. Staff were friendly but professional and the B777 was clean and in excellent condition. Couldn't ask for more. This was my return flight but the outward flight was just as good. Credit to British Airways - there was a woman near me who was terriifed of flying and one of the flight attendants sat with her through the landing. Poor woman was sick due to a bit of turbulence just before landing but the attendant dealt with it pefectly. I only booked a week before I flew and the price was very good. Decent offering of entertainment considering this was economy class. Any downsides? None I can think of.
1095,Sandra Schofield (United Kingdom) 16th June 2016,10/10,"""not an uncommon occurrence""","✅ Verified Review |  At the beginning of the year I booked 4 first class seats London-Kansas USA for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. At that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. At check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. After some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. At security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. Security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. When I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn't keep quiet. Once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and I requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. It arrived but I was told I could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. The flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. The staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. On talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. I had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. In the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and I was allowed to accompany her all the way. To add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. My mum refuses to fly BA again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to Virgin and other carriers. I have complained to BA but as of yet no response."
1096,N Ashton (United Kingdom) 16th June 2016,1/10,"""flight was late and chaotic""","✅ Verified Review |  For those who have alluded to there being ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" on BA flights in terms of customer service I can assure them this is not the case. I am a gold executive club member and can confirm that I have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins. My last experience was with my wife flying from London Gatwick to Faro on the 18 May 2016. Checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight. The lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. The BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms that were full. The flight was late and chaotic. A group of loud boisterous men, were virtually running the economy cabin, roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits. This resulted in my Wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic. It turned out to be a lie when the Purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a G&T on a tray. Returned home 10 days later and complained. Received a jumbled response. Cancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced - they didn’t seem to care so good luck to them."
1097,Jeremy Sparrow (United Kingdom) 16th June 2016,1/10,"""book with anyone but BA""","British Airways have randomly cancelled a flight two weeks before departure from Athens to London that now means I miss a wedding that I booked 3 months ago. I, as a gold card holder, have a connecting flight to Buenos Aires on BA. Regardless they put me on a flight that would have missed this connection. Subsequently they have put me on a flight that now actually is impossible to connect from the island I am on. Now they have said that to rebook I need to repay - thanks BA for looking after your gold card holder so well - I highly recommend book with anyone but BA for shortfall - better with Easyjet, Ryanair, cheaper and better. If they treat Gold Card holders that have 5 confirmed business bookings this way - good luck to economy travellers. I am embarrassed to be called a gold card member. You cancel flights for commercial reasons two weeks before and do not care the consequences for any long term clients."

1099,K Johnson (United States) 15th June 2016,5/10,"""did not have a good experience""","Las Vegas to London Heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with British Airways. Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever. The entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. A few decent movies but not much else. I thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight."
1100,Ian Robinson (United Kingdom) 8th June 2016,5/10,"""excellent cabin crew""","St Lucia to Gatwick with British Airways. We checked in on line and dropped the luggage off and were quickly through security. The lounge was small but quite comfortable with a nice lady serving drinks at the bar. I asked her if she could make me a Rum Punch and despite causing a small queue, she happily made me an excellent cocktail. Boarding was well organised and the flight departed on time. On board we were extremely well looked - staff were very professional and were able to find the time to chat and make my wife and I feel very comfortable. The wine choices were explained very well with the offer of tasting each bottle. Dinner was plentiful if not that exciting but the numerous glasses of wine helped to make it was an enjoyable experience. We landed on time and after a brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the French air traffic controllers strike, there may be a delay in parking the plane, we soon disembarked and were in the luggage hall within around 25 minutes. The luggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our way home. Overall a very good flight thanks in main to the excellent cabin crew."
1101,Ian Robinson (United Kingdom) 6th June 2016,8/10,"""further delay was likely""","✅ Verified Review |  We arrived at Gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to St Lucia. Check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. Before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. After tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. Obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. The on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. At this point I did venture down to the British Airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, I gave up and sat down again. At 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. During all of this time I should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines BA was conspicuous by its silence. We were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. Despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. Eventually we boarded just after 14.30. When everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. Various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from Gatwick being dumbed down by BA in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of Heathrow. I have no idea whether this is true or not but I would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from Heathrow to JFK, would BA have found a solution quicker? Once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay."
1102,M Steger (Germany) 5th June 2016,2/10,"""a mediocre service""","A mediocre service on this airline flying from London Heathrow to Stuttgart, which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. Check-in process was fine at Heathrow. After security, I went to the first class lounge on the south side of Heathrow terminal 5. The lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. The hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. There were a few bland sandwiches available as well. While the lounge itself is in a beautiful, large room, it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. Boarding process was seamless at the gate. The plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. There is very little legroom available and if you're taller than 5'11"", you're knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. Food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum. No inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever was available, which is really a disappointment given that so many other airlines are now installing this. Overall, the trip was fine but the onboard and lounge experiences could be improved."

T Long (United Kingdom) 4th June 2016",10/10,"""slowed down the process""","London to Bucharest with British Airways. The flight was slightly delayed. I wasn't impressed with the boarding process. It was a full flight and most of the passengers carried more than one piece of cabin luggage. It took some time for passengers to find space to store the luggage and this slowed down the process. This also had an impact on the speed of getting off the plane when we arrived in Bucharest. They should have been stricter with the cabin luggage allowance. As it was a more than 3 hour flight, they served a hot meal. The food was not that good but enough to survive the 3 hour plus flight."

We were returning from an overnight flight from the Dominican Republic and transfering to a domestic flight with BA. We arrived at BA's check in desk at 6am for our 9am flight, hoping to just drop our bags and relax until take off. When we arrived at check in we were advised the flight had been over booked and we would have to go on stand by. When we asked how can this be, we were advised by a manager that all airlines do this and check the small print. We stated as these flights had been bought and paid for over 6 months previous, so wanted to know how BA could re sell our seats, manager just kept repeating company policy. Manager stated we had to stay on stand by. As things turned out we did get stand by seats at the very last minute.

Very small screens and all the films and programmes advertised on the website were not in my flight. Kids had just 3 films to choose from. 'Forgot' to load our previously selected kids meals so my kids went hungry, no apology offered - food was awful. Service was not good, not at all friendly. I found my flight with Virgin Atlantic the previous year far superior on their updated 747s. Overall very poor indeed would not chose to fly BA again. They have let their standards slip considerably."
1108,S Bomford (United Kingdom) 2nd June 2016,4/10,"""little advantage using BA on this route""","London Gatwick to Lima with British Airways. This is a recently introduced non-stop route - offers a reasonable price for Club Class until you add the seat reservation charge which added a further £68 to each seat each way to the overall charge. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours at Gatwick while we waited for someone senior to sign off the repairs / fault. On the return journey the flight took off 1 hour late - no explanation and then when we arrived at Gatwick we stood for 1 hour for our luggage to appear while other flights around us arriving later collected theirs. There was little advantage if any to using BA on this route and we could have gone the existing routes through Madrid with little more hassle. The flight was comfortable, the staff pleasant and the food mediocre."

Most comfortable seats I've been in. Very ergonomic. Plane was clean. Clear screen and nice selection of music, TV shows and recent movies. Easy to navigate. I also enjoyed the multiple views of the flight from the overhead map to the mock pilot screen. Attendants were very polite and dinner was served quickly. Food was as good as I've had on Air France flights. I will definitely try to book with them for future trips."
1110,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 25th May 2016,5/10,"""boarding was painfully slow""",Flew Ibiza to Gatwick with British Airways. A massive and slow moving queue in Ibiza at 11.30pm was not a good start. No announcement about a delay but plane took off 45 minutes late. Boarding was painfully slow. A late night flight so no refreshments. Good excuse to save money but I guess people prefer to sleep. Flight was not busy compared to totally full outbound flight a few days before but return ticket was costly.

C Wei (United Kingdom) 24th May 2016",5/10,"""one of my favourite airlines""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Paris CDG in business class. British Airways has always been one of my favourite airlines. However, there are just a few points that really bugs me. The business class check in counter queue was longer in comparison to other counter (e.g economy) at Terminal 5. At security, the fast track queue were also longer."
1112,Leo Walters (United States) 24th May 2016,8/10,"""exception is British Airways""","✅ Verified Review |  Every airline which offers Business Class Travel will assign seats when booking the flight. The exception is British Airways. In January, 2016 I booked a flight for two passengers on BA in Business Class from San Francisco to London and back for travel in May/June. Seats in Business Class are not assigned until 48 hours before flight time. However, and here comes another BA first: If you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee. I ended up shelling out $484 - for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight. This on top of the steep fare charged for travel in Business Class. I don’t begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactics as described in order to further maximize profitability, I rebel."

Checked in on line and got the boarding card sent to my BA app. When it came to boarding there were only 14 of us booked on the flight so it required some tinkering by the ground staff to enable the aircraft balance and as a result 10 of the 14 passengers got given new seats - fortunately, I got to keep 11A. Flight time was 55 mins in which I was, unexpectedly, served a full cooked breakfast. The female member of cabin crew was very efficient."

Comfort on the A321 was very good, stylish leather seats with adjustable headrests. I had mixed feelings about the Boeing 747 to Sao Paulo. The headrests and recline were very good, however IFE was very outdated and limited, and because of the seat recline, hard to see the screen. Also personal space when the passanger in front was in full recline became almost claustophobic. On all flights I found the crew professional, friendly but somewhat reserved. I found the quality and quantity of catering very good."

Flight delayed to Glasgow so asked if I could go on the earlier flight (no baggage etc.) ""Sorry madam, there are empty seats, but the time of sales has passed so we cannot put you on the earlier flight that leaves in 30 minutes"". Other airlines let you fly standby except for British Airways. They delay a flight and won't switch you to an earlier flight that has space due to ridiculous red tape. This isn't the first time that this has happened. Worst customer service ever - just pure laziness. Anytime I have the option, I will be flying a different airline."
1116,A Golding (United Kingdom) 20th May 2016,1/10,"""poor customer service""","✅ Verified Review |  My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. The redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. Big mistake. Since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. Here is the reply we received from BA customer relations: ""We've received a reply from Mumbai who've investigated your case. The agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. He did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. He also mentioned BA wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" This is an outright lie. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. Poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up."

This was the first time I've flown with British Airways and it will also be the last. Are British Airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible? This is certainly how it seems with the awful cabin service we experienced. Our food was literally thrown at us with not a hint of a smile. The gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink, to which she replied ""if you want another drink you'll have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself as I have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drinks for you"". Strange as I thought they were there to help passengers. We thought we were just unlucky with this journey but sadly not, as the return journey was pretty much the same. Miserable, unhelpful and downright rude cabin crew. Very disappointed as I thought British Airways would have a bit more class than this."

Having found out we heading off on our honeymoon the champagne flowed and they looked after us so well. In particular an Irish FA was amazing to us and I'd like to thank him and the staff on the flight. We will recommend British Airways to friends and family and this trip would make me choose BA for future flights.

J Hugo (United Kingdom) 19th May 2016",10/10,"""service in a very discreet way""","✅ Verified Review |  I was scheduled to be on BA 114 from JFK to LHR on 17th of May. When I conducted online check-in I was informed that the flight will be one hour late. I proceed to JFK and at check in they kindly moved me to an earlier flight (BA172). Check in was easy and smooth. Terminal 7 at JFK is nothing exciting. Very limited shopping/dining and not enough seating. It feels like a LCC terminal. I was greeted by friendly crew once onboard. The hardware again is very dated - tiny screen, old seat and interior. Legroom was decent though, and because the flight is empty I had plenty of space to stretch out. The flight left JFK with a minor delay. As it's a light flight most passengers were sleeping. Service was done in a very discreet way. The food quality is nothing to write home about. Overall it's a typical BA flight. Very efficient and friendly crew with a very dated and unattractive product. We arrived at Heathrow early despite the late departure in JFK. T5 was a pleasant airport to arrive. Spacious and airy, and there was no queue in immigration. It took me less than 30 minutes to leave the airplane, travel from T5C to T5A, clear immigration and collect luggage."

Round trip fare of GBP 549 is cheap."
1121,G Seeter (United States) 16th May 2016,9/10,"""not be flying BA again""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Newark. Two evenings prior to my flight I used British Airways Android app to reserve extended legroom seats for my wife and me. At the time, advance reservation of regular seats was $51 and $59 for front-section extended legroom seats. I had no interest in reserving a regular seat (I could wait until 24 hours before check-in for that) but I was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats. So I paid the $118 for the two front-section seats. When my wife and I boarded the craft, lo and behold, the seats were not front-section seats at all! I was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my Android Phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely, apologizing to us, offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of post-flight. However, subsequent to the flight, British Airways has been positively nasty in their response, claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued (true enough) and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front-section when they were not. The fact that I received zero goods or services for my $118 beyond what I was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them. They have managed to bilk me out of $118 and having gotten their hands on my money, they intend to keep it. We'll see what my credit card company has to say about this, but it would be a lot smoother if we could simply settle this amicably, rather than forcing me to dispute the charge with my credit card company. Suffice it to say that my wife and I will not be flying BA again."
1122,Christine Johnson (United Kingdom) 16th May 2016,1/10,"""Total rip off BA""","Gatwick to Funchal. What has happened to BA club Europe? You used to get wider seats and more leg room than economy. Not any more. Same seats as economy but with middle seat blocked. Breakfast ok but not brilliant. Staff were good and I enjoyed the champagne but was it worth paying for club class? No it wasn't. We were lucky and got row 2 by the food galley which meant extra legroom but that was more luck than design. I wouldn't fly Club Europe again unless I was guaranteed this seat but to get it I would have to pay £18 per person each way on top of the club fares. Total rip off BA. Before we flew I was going to book British Airways to Bangkok. Based on this experience though I'll stick to EVA Air. Additionally the club lounge at Gatwick was dire. No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to BA and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge. The tables were also filthy."

Plane was 1hr late taking off (again) - checking at previous LHR-DEN flights revealed this has happened every day in May - so I was not too surprised we were late leaving. Premium Economy seat was ok but being close to galley was a bit annoying for the noise. IFE is so outdated now - tiny screen and very poor choice of music and only a few films worth watching. Food was so-so. The lunch 1st course was some sort of salmon salad and was ok, the main course was beef and it was very dry. Desert was a chocolate mousse which was lovely. Afternoon tea was two sandwiches and a scone with cream which was quite nice. Good supply of water/drinks throughout the flight and the FA was good. Not a bad flight and I would use BA again in the future."

As usual the onboard staff are the saving grace. Going downhill BA."
1125,S Williams (United Kingdom) 14th May 2016,5/10,"""journey was chaotic and stressful""","✅ Verified Review |  British Airways have seriously gone downhill. There is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - I would actually prefer easyjet and Ryanair as at least they are transparent. This journey from Lyon to London Heathrow was chaotic and stressful. Thanks to BA charging £30 to check in luggage one way, every passenger takes cabin baggage. This means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. The boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - I have honestly never seen anything like it. Once on board, they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn't fit. Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. The meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwich. As always with BA flights to and from LHR, this flight was late. We ended up flying round and round over London for 30 mins. The worst thing is BA's new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening 24 hours before. This means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay £12 just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom). BA's new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process). A shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost. I will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible."
1126,Matteo Tonelli (United States) 12th May 2016,1/10,"""operated by American Airlines""","Pisa to Chicago via London Heathrow. This route is one that I have done many times. Bought my ticket using British Airways miles and their part of the trip did not disappoint. The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine, there were IFE and food and beverages served. I proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of movies, when I searched for action and adventure there was only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems. There was no way to sit comfortably and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually operated by British Airways, that arrives at the same time. Next time I fly this route with them I will make sure to not get an American Airlines leg, especially long haul. Truly unpleasant experience for the most of my journey."

No refreshments offered while waiting. Boarded at 11:00pm to leave at 1:00 am. 2 hours waiting in the aircraft with no entertainment available. Staff were very polite and helped as much as they could. Then arrived in London with 3 hours delay, almost impossible to get information from rude staff at Heathrow airport. We're able to be put on the next flight to Paris. Then it took over an hour to go through security and we almost missed our flight. ""Luckily"", flight was delayed 45 minutes so we caught it. When we arrived bags had not arrived and were delivered home the following day. Since the connection took over an hour, I called British Airways to change my flight in 2 weeks (since I have 1h10m to get to the second plane, chances are I won't be able to catch it). I was told I would have to pay 150€ (even though flight is 200€ cheaper compared to when I bought it) and that I would most likely be put on the next plane to Los Angeles, through American Airlines. So I haven't taken my flight that I'm kind of feeling I might be missing it. Not very accommodating."

Good service from FAs, and a high quality screen for IFE. But what a shame that otherwise British Airways business class seats badly need up-dating. Once a trail blazer, British Airways is now an also-ran. Why didn't they ensure that the company took advantage of its new aircraft to bring its facilities up to date, to make up at least some of the ground on the Gulf and leading Asian carriers?"
1129,P Trevatt (United Kingdom) 9th May 2016,7/10,"""economy seats sold as business""",Flew British Airways business class from London Heathrow to Santorini. The seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. No leg room and BA attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (A/C and D/E). The problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. At least If the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. Our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. Flight was full in business (9 rows taken up) and quickly became stuffy. Since this is an economy seat at a business price it is almost impossible to work out BAs business strategy. Will not fly on this leg again with BA and will take my custom to an alternate airline.

Checked in on line and used bag drop at LGW North Terminal which was quick, as was the fast track security. Not a normal user of Gatwick, using LHR every month but found LGW had improved a lot since my last visit 5 years ago. The lounge used by BA is the No1 Travellers lounge which was ok - pretty full and service a little slow. Boarding onto an ex BMI A319 via a bus but pretty well organised, seat 3F the old Club Europe layout. Food and crew okay on this 2hr 35min flight arrived just about on time. Return no online check in available so checked in at the airport by a rude Iberia agent, no lounge either at Ibiza but not a problem. Late departure of around 1 hr boarded by bus onto A320 with new seat layout, seat 1A which was nice. Crew friendly, service and food on this flight were better than I've had on BA for a while - arrived about 30 min late on to a bridge, bags off very quick so no complaints. I would use LGW again, BA I use most months."

The onboard food and drinks are a shadow of what they used to be but fares in real terms are much lower these days and this is an acceptable trade-off. This particular flight from Dubai to London was packed and I certainly wasn't comfortable sitting next to a large guy, squished into one side of my seat. But the cabin crew were fine and one attendant was charming. It's only when I pay to fly business or first that I get irritated. I'd put British Airways ahead of many rivals in economy and behind in premium classes, where the food is particularly disappointing."

Even with a full plane, check in was fine and well organised boarding, plus the flight was on time. The food was very good (really!), except the tateless cardboard wrap just before landing, and there were multiple drinks runs thoughout the flight. An adequate if small movie selection, service with a smile. Best economy class flight I've had for years. It's great to see that BA can still do it very well and provide such an experience.

After a very nice first flight from Tampa to Chicago with my wife and our 15 months old baby, transit in Chicago was really smooth. Our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal. We did not have to pass security a second time, so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. As a gold member I checked the First lounge, but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too. We found a quiet ""dinner part"" of the business lounge, were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax. Food was decent. Boarding the upper deck of this Boeing 747-400 was a pleasure with a CSD welcoming us by name. Flight was excellent: food amazing, enough cold drinks were offered, cabin crew looking after us and our baby. Our baby was playing all the time, singing and talking his own words. After this perfect flight, transit in LHR terminal was again relaxing. Stroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. After security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded, but we found a quiet place to sit. Time for a shower, breakfast and relax. Last flight to Amsterdam was in a full cabin, nice and frriendly cabin crew. The only small remark we can find, is that this last flight there was no stroller waiting for us, but it arrived with our luggage."

On the return flight the seats were worn and old, screens were old and scratched the children weren’t given their choice of meals as they had run out, my three year old was given snack a box containing nuts my husband sitting next to her was asleep I was in the row behind and quickly took it away as she’s allergic. I could go on but you get the picture. The man sat next to me didn’t get any food on a 7hr plus flight – he was vegetarian and they had run out of pasta.

They offered me a downgrade that I could not accept for health reasons. If they had told me they were overbooked when I tried to check in online, I could have rerouted via New York and still arrived in time for an important meeting. As it was, I arrived 7 hours late and missed my meeting. British Airways only cares about maximising its profits. It cares nothing for its passengers. I have been a loyal customer of BA for over 50 years. For many years I was a gold card holder and this is how they treat me. They sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after I had paid the full and non refundable fare. They used to be good. their strapline, ""The World's Favourite Airline"" was not far from the truth. No longer! They are rapidly becoming the world's least favourite airline"

This time, we had the experience of the new Boeing 787 which was very nice and new, and we found the seats just as comfortable, particularily in Premium Economy. What we did not enjoy was the change in attitude from the staff, they seemed so different to the crews we had looking after us on the previous runs. The emphasis was on getting things served as fast as they can, and woe betide you if you want extra milk for your cup of coffee! The food was good, and we felt safe and efficiently cared for, but there was not the fun around that we used to encounter when wandering around in the small hours of the flight, when you could go to the galley and get a coffee or a snack. After all this is a long haul flight, and I can well understand the rush on a short haul flight. The person behind us was air sick, which was not their fault, and the cabin crew dealt with this well. Our return flight was better, and we enjoyed the glass of fizzy prior to take off, which is a nice touch, and is something that other airlines do in Premium Economy. I think that BA managers should travel with other airlines to review its premium economy brand. Finally, I think the breakfast is not very nice, and could be improved upon. Like another passenger, we went and had something after landing, those breakfast boxes are horrible!"

It transpires we have to contact BA ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. This sums up British Airways now, as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they aren't provided with and then BA making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money, customer service is non existent. Other than this, all 4 flights we took were late, our son was given child meals we hadn't booked, the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting, one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats. An internal Virgin America flight we took had more space and more comfortable seating than BA's A380. I cannot find anything positive to say about them."

Many calls later still no refund. Promised on 11 April would get refund within 72 hours. As of 15 April BA can’t say when will be refunded. Payment due 17 April  for replacement BA flight booked after first flight was cancelled and need refund to pay balance. BA don’t care, holding £353 and won’t say when it will be refunded. Loyal customer for 28 years. Appalling customer service and BA say if payment due on 17th April not made for replacement booking it will be cancelled and I will lose £150 deposit despite the fact they are keeping £353 of my money and have lied repeatedly as to when it will be refunded. BA flights are now a nightmare, last 3 flights travelled on were delayed due to hand baggage only passengers marauding up and down the aisle trying to stuff oversize hand luggage into overhead lockers with no care or consideration for other passengers possessions. Captain had to announce unless people sat down and allowed hand baggage to be placed in hold, plane would be further delayed. British Airways needs to decide whether it wants to be a no frills airline or not, it is now worse than Ryanair or Easyjet. Not a pleasant experience to fly BA anymore. Despite having problems of one type or another on nearly every booking made with BA in the last few years, continued to be loyal to them but they do not appreciate customer loyalty despite their recorded customer services message claiming they want to maintain high standards after travel and wish to ensure a passenger flies with BA again, they fail on all counts."

Having taken my food order before others on the outbound sector, I was a bit surprised to find they had given ""my"" risotto to another passenger. They were very apologetic however and allowed me to choose something from the First menu. Aside from that, the journeys were uneventful, and the quality of food was better than the last few times. Overall I'm quite happy with this latest BA experience."

Albert Wong (China) 13th April 2016",8/10,"""the service is good""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew London to Beijing with British Airways. The flight leaves from Heathrow Terminal 5, normally Beijing flight leaves from B Gates, so I made myself comfortable at the B Gate lounge which is 100 times better than the two A Gate congested lounges before the flight. It was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable, though quite full. The BA Club seats are configured 8 across and the seat is not as wide as competitor's, but just enough. CX may have better seat but BA sometime offers good value. The service is good. It has a Chinese crew and unlike with Cathay, the crew are always the same on this route (because they are based in China specifically for the London route), so a frequent flyer may be recognized and get treated better. It was an on time flight."
1145,S Davis (Canada) 13th April 2016,8/10,"""food was above average""","✅ Verified Review |  This was my second time flying with British Airways and this particular route from Vancouver to Paris CDG via London Heathrow. Round trip was overall on time without delay. Online check in was easy and got to pick out the seats I wanted. Picked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problems. The food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional. Drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently. Washrooms were clean. Overall a satisfactory experience. However, one thing almost all travellers on the YVR-LHR route will notice is the age of this aircraft. I think it should be replaced soon, since this is a very popular route. I flew in late March and return beginning of April, being low season but the cabin was still full. I think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the A380. Particularly, the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket. The in-flight entertainment system is also very out dated, pictures were not clear and colours were rather misleading."

Nothing special for a short flight but was happy that it was on time. It is interesting that for short haul flight BA uses seating that the business seats are the same as Economy except that the central seat is kept empty. And on this flight it was not full, so I have similar space with my next seat unoccupied. Snack was offered free, though not hot, together with a drink."

Albert Wong (China) 12th April 2016",7/10,"""the flight was satisfactory""","✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to London with British Airways. I normally prefer aisle seats for long haul but this flight I chose a window seat, because it was an A380 flight on the upper deck. The upper deck situation means that I can take advantage of a window side drawer where apart from easy storage I can also put something on top. And Premium Economy offers just enough space to move out if needed. BA's Premium Economy service is good, the food is not the same for economy as in the case of some airlines, and the seat acceptably comfortable. BA is generous on alcoholic drinks though I do not take advantage of it. But the food is not very good. All in all the flight was satisfactory."

I had a bulkhead seat which meant I had plenty of legroom and could stretch out on the flight. The cabin looked a bit tired but the staff were friendly and professional and I was comfortable. The food was quite good but a glass of champagne when we boarded would have been nice. The IFE was okay but the screen was small and it malfunctioned during part of the flight."

Hwei Ming Choo (United Kingdom) 1st April 2016",10/10,"""same seat as economy class""","✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Rome Fiumicino. If anyone has flown British Airways Club Europe, you'll realise it's the same seat as their economy class EuroTraveller with a seat made into a divider in the middle. As I was flying from Gatwick, the BA lounge was under refurbishment and was directed into No 1. lounge which was quite packed already. When I got to Rome, my baggage was lost. To make matters worse, the counter for lost baggage which operates on behalf of British Airways was very poorly marked. There was no sign or logo of British Airways. It was manned by two person which hadn't had a clue what was going on and would only assist in filling up the forms. To make matters worse, they were talking to each other leaving my partner and I just awkwardly staring at them to complete their conversation. Bottom line is, whatever carries the British Airway brand name is good. Whatever 3rd party organisation which BA employs, are questionable."

Outbound segment on an A380 and three others on refurbished B747-400 aircraft.  As a regular 20-year customer and a Gold level Executive Club member, one has to expect much variation in the BA onboard product. Staff are generally polite and hardworking, some are not very well trained, so seem to lack the extra attention to detail that should come with Club World. The fish main course served between IAD and LHR was unbelievably bad, but other meals were fairly good. High Tea without scones, clotted cream and strawberry jam is an absurd cost-cutting measure on a British airline, as I discovered on the LHR-IAD sector. It is sad to see this airline not working harder in response to the competition."
1154,R Carter (United Kingdom) 31st March 2016,7/10,"""aircraft was very old and dated""","Miami to Manchester via London Heathrow with British Airways. The aircraft was very old and dated, and too hot with no airconditioning above the seat. Food was disgusting - some type of chicken mashed up with potato and peas. These 747 aircraft need to be updated or retired as they are now showing their age. Tv screens are so small and have no USB or power points. Outbound flight was with American Airlines that was so much better. New aircraft, good entertainment and food with was good. Now that you have to change terminals at LHR when connecting from Miami, there is no advange of flying BA. So if you can choose a different airline or if you have to fly BA, avoid the 747. The A320 on the domestic flight to Manchester was very comfy and looked so much better."
1155,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 31st March 2016,3/10,"""approaching a national tragedy""","British Airways in my mind is fast approaching a national tragedy. As one who has flown them on/off for 35 years I suggest I am qualified to have a view - having travelled in all cabins including Concorde. We flew Club Europe from London Heathrow to Pisa and back this last week over the Easter break. We have a home in Italy and fly the route often. Flight out started in the North Executive lounge at LHR. It was not busy and was OK. Terrible choice of unhealthy bacon baps and similar rolls stuffed with whatever. I had some fruit - tinned fruit. Plane was a newish plane and the so called ""new"" Club Europe. Three seats - with the middle one as a ""table"". Tables are usually in front of one - not to the side. Zero legroom unless you are in row ""1"". Last month I flew the regional Business Class on Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Needless to say - British Airways does not come close when it comes to seat comfort. Disgraceful. Food okay on both flights. FAs on both flights were also fine. The curtain separating the Club cabin from Economy was broken, hence we had queues for the WC stretching into the Club cabin.Its long overdue - but BA need some serious management changes to build value into their key products."
1156,Tim Francis (United Kingdom) 31st March 2016,2/10,"""worst flight for some time""","St Lucia to London Gatwick in Premium Economy on 30th March, and I had the worst flight I have had for some time on British Airways. No newspaper, inedible curry chicken, no wine, no coffee. Breakfast again was inedible and no coffee. Inflight entertainment awful with old films on very small screen. Oxygen levels very low with many passengers complaining of headaches etc. Staff not interested yet as usual British Airways employees sneak into business class and seemed to get a reasonable service! As usual, you say never use them again on this route but very little choice as only competition is Virgin and they are not that good either. Compared to airlines like Emirates, Qantas, Air New Zealand etc, BA have much to learn. Have used Thomsons to Barbados and Mauritius in Premium Club section on the Boeing 787 and it was a fantastic experience. Great food, service comfy seats and super in flight entertainment."

Boarding via gate 23, the flight departed around 40 minutes late but arrived around 10 minutes late which was fine. Snack and coffee served during the 1hr 10 min flight. Return check in a bit slow but once checked in used the galleries lounge for a quick coffee. Boarding at gate 5 on to a full 767 with business seating which was nice, departed on time for a flight of just over an hour, bags tagged priority so off quick. I much prefer the 767 on this route as apposed to the A320."
1161,A Asprakis (United States) 20th March 2016,6/10,"""degraded its economy product""","Philadelphia to London Heathrow and return, both in new cabin. British Airways has degraded its economy product to the point where US airline companies may actually offer a better service. On the 777, BA has removed the toilets in the rear to cram in more seats, causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. The new economy seating feels incredibly camped, the food on offer is of poor quality and of increasingly smaller portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't see any reason to continue to fly this airline. I also find it ridiculous that BA charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance, making me have to stress out about checking in on time while on vacation to ensure that I can snap up whatever good seat is left by that time. My next trip to Europe has been booked with American, and I am already seeing a difference - I was able to choose a regular seat for free at the time of booking, and I will accrue the full amount of miles that I am actually flying. Although all BA staff were incredibly courteous and competent on this trip, that does not make up for the current sad state of the economy product. Bye bye BA."

1163,Chris Harper (United Kingdom) 18th March 2016,1/10,"""in my case worth the money""","Travelled British Airways from London to Nairobi return and excellent flight both ways - outbound crew were not quite as good as the inbound crew but I wouldn't complain about. I think the Premium economy seats were a new type or at least the covering, I find it much more comfortable than the leather type, almost up to the comfort of Virgin's A340 seats when they used to go to Nairobi. Had one problem with entertainment equipment on the return flight, it was locked up on the announcement screen, despite no announcements being made, but there were empty seats we could have used. Is premium economy worth the money, in my case I say yes, 22 stone, on a 6ft 2in, 73 year old frame does not like journeys much over 3 hours in standard economy. Check in both ends good - as is usual at Nairobi with multiple security checks, but its a known fact that different people notice different things, so I see multiple checks are a good thing."

Shorthaul - it seems the drink service is less often than usual compared to previous BA flights. The new slimline seats feel more spacious, but in my opinion it has less padding compared to the old ones. Food quite good, pilots great as always. Longhaul - Upperdeck A380. Food main courses quite decent but the snacks inbetween and in the galley absolutely terrible. Seats feel very cramped on the A380 in economy class. Also unacceptable to charge so much to choose seats. A380 always seems to have a delayed departure (plane too big for its own good?) Entertainment fairly good. Will be interesting to compare with the competition, as plan on trying another airline next time."

1167,Meg Ferguson (United Kingdom) 15th March 2016,10/10,"""turf you into cattle class""","Austin to London Heathrow. I spent a considerable amount of time in Jan and Feb, booking these seats, and I had to pay over £70 for the privilege. BA systems were not working properly and I had to get phone help - to find the cause, but at the 15th attempt, I managed to book the seats. I like a window seat, mid cabin, in a number that divides by 3. Our flight was called, I went to the gate, with people behind me. The bar code on the bag drop issued boarding pass wouldnt scan. He asked his colleague who had other boarding passes, that still wouldnt scan. His other colleague thought it might be my passport and went off to check. I made the point that I had been in the airport three hours so if there was something wrong, surely they could have contacted me? The colleague came back. The bar codes still wouldnt scan and I heard one of them say 'they are already through'. I said I had booked a window seat for hubby and hoped the new one was. He said they were but by their numbers I could see they werent. Got on board. There was someone already in those seats!! I found an attendant, who went off and found us two seats. No window, across the aisle from the loo. So all night we heard the loo flushing and got bumped by people waiting and falling about due to turbulence. That would be why they were free.  I did look to where my booked seats were. There was a family of five in that row, that obviously wanted to be together. So though I was in a different bit of the cabin that might have been premium economy, as I was offered a hot flannel and some warm fizzy win in a plastic glass, I was certainly not upgraded. Doesn't matter if you pay for seat reservations, 6 weeks in advance. If somebody comes along later they'll turf you into cattle class. And to think I stopped using Ryanair!"

The A320 felt quite cramped in Economy but the energetic and motivated cabin crew made the flight enjoyable. Later on were very happy to have the bigger and newer Boeing 777W on the Mumbai sector, where the last few rows had empty seats and we were able to stretch our legs properly, which was a great bonus. The IFE was good and the 2 hot meals served quite tasty and filling. In addition, the cabin crew were again excellent. On the way back flight was more than 2.5hrs late out of BOM which would have meant a missed connection at LHR late Saturday night, the last flight out to HEL that night. Asked the BOM station manager to be put on Jet Airways since they seemed to be on time, had to wait until the very last minute due to a fully booked flight, but finally got two seats on Jet to catch the connecting flight at LHR the same evening. The very positive experience with BA on HEL-LHR-BOM as well as the rerouting that was carried out in an exemplary manner make us praise British Airways. Very good experience made by experienced and cooperative BA staff at all stations. Will fly again."
1169,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 13th March 2016,10/10,"""crew polite but not friendly""","We flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana in economy and flew back in Premium economy. Was it worth it? Well we didn't pay too much more, so probably overall yes - just about. But other than slightly more legroom you don't get much! Same food as economy as far as I could tell. Main meal was nice. Breakfast was not good enough for an airline of this supposed calibre - small cold cheese croissant and muesli bar! Only one tea/coffee round and then they whipped round to collect the empties. We got to board before the economy passengers but that's no big deal. We had to pay extra to secure seats at the side in a pair. Otherwise, we would have had to sit in a block of 4 in the middle which we don't like. I begrudged paying the extra for this to be honest. Captain was cheery and informative, and apologised endlessly for the short delay leaving Punta Cana. Crew were polite but not friendly. Ours was an older guy who had an air of 'I've been doing this a long time and I'm pretty fed up with passengers'. Whilst I can understand this,  if you feel like that about your job, you need to move on. The flight only landed slightly late and having made up a lot of time en route would have been on time had it not been for air traffic congestion at Gatwick which I can well believe. Same old awful out of date IFE. Seats, despite being wider, were very uncomfortable."

Cabin was comfortable, amenities, pyjamas etc of good quality. Food was rather dull, and not well prepared, perhaps 5-spice duck is not the best for an airline cabin. Wines and spirits were of good quality, and we arrived on time and in good shape. De-planing was efficient, and as expected in Singapore Changi, everything functioned well. The return flight  on March 3rd was not so good. The crew were sleepy and not particularly communicative; you had to ask for everything, even the meal schedule, and it took ages for dirty crockery to be cleared up. The flight arrived early, which was good, but as usual, Terminal 5 was still asleep, inefficient and ineffectual. We did not use the usual immigration channel, but it looked chaotic, as was the baggage re-claim nowadays."

The British Airways lounge at the airport has been closed for some time and therefore they are sharing the paid for No 1 lounge. It's overcrowded, me and my family couldn't get in to use it. The check in staff apologised about it, so they clearly know the problem. BA should inform the customer prior to booking that they are not able to provide the full service. British Airways customer services response was to inform me of their future plans, not very helpful. I would not recommend flying business class short haul out of Gatwick.

Friendly cabin crew (ground staff a little sultry), clean modern cabin. Good announcements explained delay, and an attentive service for the flight. I pre booked our meal which means it comes far earlier than the wine and drinks, and without a few additions, such as cheese and crackers - but staff returned later with missing items. Not sure I'd pay for Premium Economy as really not a great deal of difference, other than space and food. Good selection of entertainment. Cabin crew present and attentive with juice and water for the flight. A good cup of tea and a kit kat available."
1173,D Day (United Kingdom) 8th March 2016,8/10,"""end-to-end experience poor""","Flight from Heathrow to Chicago  delayed over three hours, with a litany of excuses for Boeing 747-400 going tech, faulty smoke alarm in toilet, catering truck damaged fuselage door, engineers couldn't correct fault. BA would not let us off the flight. Captain came to First Class and answered questions, which was a nice personal touch. When we finally got going, food and cabin service were very mediocre. BA First Class seat is a very, very poor product, and entertainment screen slow. IAD-LHR return on the A380 in First Class. The A380 is a wonderful aircraft, woefully let down by the poor BA First Class seats and service, the seats are barely Business Class by modern standards, and the dinner service was inelegant and almost inedible. Crew on return were impersonal, and keen to get the dinner service over. Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience. This is what you get with a quasi-monopoly to the USA from London. The only merit was the superb A380. Let us hope BA replace their aged Boeing 747-400 with this aircraft, but in doing so, improve the terrible seat configuration of First and Club Class."
1174,Jeff Evans (United Kingdom) 8th March 2016,2/10,"""product can be so variable""","One feature of British Airways these days, is that its product can be so variable. On this basis, I had low expectations of a recent flight from Heathrow to Athens. The plane was an old 767 and being phased out. However the crew were professional and attentive, food was good, plenty of drink available and the inflight entertainment comprised the latest Star Wars movie. Given the very low price I paid for the ticket - no complaints. My worry is the accountants that run the airline and always chipping away at the soft product."

After a chaotic boarding, the flight LHR-ACC was smooth with comfortable seats which felt softer than the newer and narrower. Food was good, the attitude of cabin staff positive and professional and the movie selection good. I was however surprised by the smaller Audio selection than experienced on previous flights, especially concerning rhytmical music. 1.5 hour before landing a second serving took place. It was a good experience flying BA, and I do not hesitate in recommending this airline. Only concern is the limited space for hand luggage - BA should more strictly control the hand luggage of the passengers is within the limits given - way too many passsengers ignored this on this and the return flight."

British Airways has a good way of reminding you that you're flying cattle class. The interior was tired and worn, and the seat was hard. The legroom was inadequate for a short-haul flight. The cabin service was variable, while some were courteous, others practically barked at you. One steward even tapped me and gestured me for a refill.  On the bright side, there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol. I have had the fortune of sitting in front of three very loud and progressively intoxicated ladies who pressed for the stewardess for more alcohol every 10 minutes on the flight - requests promptly obliged. Perhaps I should have taken the advantage of this generosity to make the flight more bearable."

Craig Cutts (United Kingdom) 7th March 2016",4/10,"""food offered was pretty basic""","London to Helsinki return. Check in at T3 quick as was fast track security. I visited the BA lounge in T3 which is nice and used by other Oneworld airlines, apart from being packed there was very limited food on offer at 10am. Boarding was slow and done by bus to a remote stand, onboard the seated in 1A with a fee seat next to me. I was looking forward to something decent to eat due to the lack of food options in the lounge - unfortunately the food offered was pretty basic to say the least. The crew where friendly which I guess was something. Arriving in Helsinki on time to another remote stand and bus transfer bags where off quickly despite any priority tagging. Check in for the return was quick, security a little slow but once through I headed for the Finnair lounge which was packed with no seating. I managed to find a seat in a computer booth have a coffee and check my emails. Boarding was awful with no priority and once again a 10 minute bus ride on a packed bus to then stand in the freezing cold and sleet for a further 10 minutes boarding via steps. After a delayed 1hr departure service began with a drink followed by another very basic meal of 3 half sandwiches and a scone. Crew were okay and kept passengers updated on the delayed arrival. Finally arrived 1 hr late but with the luxury of an airbridge. Bags off quickly which was good. Otherwise a business class on a 3hr flight with no in seat power, economy seating with middle seat blocked. Standard food offered in economy on other airlines. There is no class in BA's European business class anymore. Added to the poor downgrading of the BA frequent flier scheme it's a no brainer for me."

Kevin Murphy-Steele (United Kingdom) 6th March 2016",3/10,"""excessive hand baggage""","Flew from EDI-LHR-PHL-LHR-EDI in World Traveller. Outbound shuttle to Heathrow was a Boeing 767-300 in all economy layout, managed to bag seats 1F/1G using online checkin. Cheery, friendly crew - biggest problem is the excessive hand baggage allowance permitted on BA. Selfish people take huge cases on board, filling up the lockers so everyone with more modestly sized items can't get a look in. Cabin crew quite stressed trying to move cases around lockers to get everyone sat down. LHR-PHL upgraded to the rearmost group of two seats on Row 35 on  Boeing 777-200. BA has now cheekily increased the cost of these to £48 each - used to be only £33 like the rest of the cabin. Wisecracking captain over the tannoy made the flight a little more entertaining - again great crew, I could eat the meal for once. Only thing that went wrong was the IFE on my seat crashed in the last 90 minutes of the flight - I could only view the flight tracker. On a side note, I wish BA would upgrade the album choice, they haven't changed it in the last year. Flight was on time no delays. Inbound PHL-LHR I reserved a seat for £33 each, but note you cannot buy the back row on the middle group - reserved for the crew. Plane encountered severe turbulence between Nantucket and Newfoundland, crew had to rush the drinks and the meal service as a result.  No apologies from the pilots about this which BA usually does. LHR-EDI problems about excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller A320.  It was the same steward by sheer coincidence that served us on the outbound shuttle a week earlier and he did remember us, and asked us how our holiday in Philadelphia went! Otherwise flight was pleasant and did what it said on the tin. Overall it was a good value trip - I booked it through BA Holidays, and it being off-season meant the total cost was £940 (before seat upgrades) including 8 days car rental. One observation however it that it is now clear that BA cares little about its economy passengers (who now seem to exist to make up the numbers) - everything now seems to be geared around their high-spending Executive Club members. Avios earning has been drastically cut in the World Traveller cabin class, so a discounted fare now only attracts 0.25 Avios in the mile. Therefore a transatlantic flight to the East Coast of the USA (which used to get 3250 points), now only attracts a measily 815. Pretty pathetic really. I really only use British Airways via LHR for USA trips purely on the basis of using large widebody planes (unlike American and United who increasingly use Boeing 757s) , and their holidays deals which are hard to beat and enable payment instalments."
1180,Mark Kamensek (United States) 28th February 2016,5/10,"""flight was amazing""","Washington to Heathrow with British Airways and I have to say that the IAD ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. I sprained my neck just 2 days before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. The flight itself was amazing - the A380 is just like a rock in the sky, I didn't feel a thing. The seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on United. The premium economy is more like domestic business class on most US carriers (older style business class not the new business first). The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. They are hard to find if they even exist. I'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best I got was a brusque ""sorry that's all there is."" When you see someone limping away from your desk - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge. I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately."
1181,Barry Dennis (United Kingdom) 27th February 2016,7/10,"""no entertainment""","First time my partner and I have flown British Airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from London Heathrow to Cape Town. I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat. I certainly wouldn't pay BA's rate for Premium Economy again."
1182,Gordon Hulme (United Kingdom) 27th February 2016,2/10,"""BA has become so complacent""","British Airways from Manchester to Rio de Janeiro via Heathrow. Weren't invited to the lounge at MAN due to a rather arrogant check in agent. The Concord Lounge at LHR has seen better days - ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic, so left it! Champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. Nuts were pleasant. Seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. First choice of food not available, which is unacceptable in First. Then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. Staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. We ended being split up, partner on row 4, me on row 2! Nice start to our honeymoon, thanks BA. Cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. Staff upgrades are commonplace on BA in First and the cabin had by my reckoning, 5 paying passengers and I'd say about 4 staff upgrades (all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate). These 'mates' of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. Personally I'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat, but BA seem to think it's acceptable for staff to travel in First. If you're on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade, I'd say you're chances are pretty remote, unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight! A pretty poor experience all round which proves that the once 'worlds favourite airline' has become so complacent that they can't even get it right in First Class. Is it any wonder the Middle East carriers are showing the rest of the world how to do it!"
1183,Debra Alexander (United States) 27th February 2016,3/10,"""customer service is abysmal""","Glad I have the option to rate them a zero. Their customer service is abysmal.  Was flying home from Amsterdam with my family. Booked on premium economy, which was around $700 pp higher than economy. The night before my early morning flight I received a text saying flight was cancelled. Went to the airport. No BA employees were there. Could not get BA on the phone. Woman from another airline booked us on Delta in regular economy. Have spent since August trying to get a refund of the $700 pp extra I paid for premium economy. Finally got the refund. Was $149 pp with no explanation. Customer service people are very sorry but they can't help me. There is no higher level to take this to. I had to go on a separate form to request the breakdown to see how they calculated the refund. I expect more out of British Airways, but I will never fly them again."
1184,Ray Santos (United States) 26th February 2016,1/10,"""Service top notch ""","Flew British Airways from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via London Heathrow r/t in Club World. Actually prefer the B777 over the A380 which was surprising. We used the Qantas FC lounge in LAX and Galleries First at Heathrow. Both were great. Service on board all flights top notch and friendly. Food and drinks good, even if the steak was a bit on the well done side. Like that you can pre-select meals out of LHR. Wish you could do this out of LAX as well. My complaint is Club Europe legroom. I know they block out the middle seat, but at 6'2"" the legroom is tight. All in all great value for the money. We picked up three trips on BA during their Business Class sale last year. Next in FCO, and then DUB."

D Walker (United Kingdom) 26th February 2016",8/10,"""staff friendly and efficient""","Our first time flying to Dominican Republic and found the best deal with British Airways and the benefit was it is a direct flight from Gatwick to Punta Cana. On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry. They are very small, and the anti-glare screen is hard to see from you need to keep adjusting the brightness of the screen throughout the movie. The range of movies was good. Food was ok nothing special and not really a choice."

1187,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 25th February 2016,3/10,"""like sleeping on a park bench""","Flight got off to a good start with a reasonable dinner in the Malaysian Airlines first Class lounge. I was looking forward to my first flight on the Boeing 787 -  so much so, I switched from Singapore / LHR to KL when I discovered the 787-9 operated on this route. The new plane is very nice indeed - the so called ""new"" - New First is not. BA trumpet they have listened to customers and this revised version was to be the new pace setter. Wrong. The FAs on the route were great and dinner was adequate. The chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad was fine. The wine was also fine. The cheap champagne nowhere near to Krug as served by other carriers in 1st Class. The usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware - we have to get used to. The seat is definitely more constrained than the 777 and A380 1st Class; its tighter and smaller. In bed mode - it is like sleeping on a park bench. So hard. The ridiculous ""island"" design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the 777 and A380. When lying on your side it digs into your back. The seat's narrow profile becomes very obvious. You have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the ""compartment"". I am 6 4"" tall and not overweight. I did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the A380 flight I took to Singapore last month. The TV screen is larger and fixed - which does not lend itself to a companion dinning with you as on the other aircraft. Its on a slight angle as well slightly facing away from the viewer. The AV remote is small and overly complicated. There is no WiFi. There is no window blinds as on the other aircraft. The windows can be dimmed to ""black"" - so you have two black orbs staring at you through the flight. BA seem clueless when it comes to a top end 1st Class. I will avoid this plane in future. A jaw dropping disappointment."

Colin Pay (United Kingdom) 25th February 2016",2/10,"""paid extra for exit row seats""","My wife and I flew British Airways London Heathrow to Athens in a Boing 767. The flight was only half full. We had paid extra for exit row seats, which were ideal. There are no seat back screens and the ones on the cabin roof failed to work, this was not a problem, not a great lover of overhead screens showing stuff you probably would not select if given the choice. Left and arrived on time."
1189,J Gwizdala (United Kingdom) 24th February 2016,9/10,"""flight just about adequate""","London Heathrow to Vancouver with British Airways. Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. Email was received on the day of travel. It did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. On the first call, there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. Fortunately we were cut off as I think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. Second call was more successful and a direct answer was given, no matter how unwelcome. Printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at LHR (I am not a frequent air traveller). A sign of the times perhaps but I did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. Not much to say about bag drop off. It was neither efficient nor inefficient, just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. The young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by Friday. At the gate, I did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area - all of 3 metres away. I suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices, because they will of course get there first! The flight was just about adequate. My video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified - well I was ignored. Fortunate, as the film and TV choice was poor.  I do not like airline food that much. There are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really drink the wine. Beer and spirits hard to get wrong. Return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. Again the flight was just about adequate. Did not eat the food as I had a salad from an outlet at YVR - good value. Flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. The seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. The only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit, and stand at the back. Whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front, she did not want to be reasonable. The attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution."

Daniel Van Gelder (United Kingdom) 13th February 2016",5/10,"""being second rate""","London Heathrow to Dubai and I feel sorry for British Airways. I have just flown one of my last ever flights with them as they have fallen into the depths of being second rate against far superior competition. The lounges at T5 Heathrow should be great, but we arrived last night at 6pm to find almost all the food offer finished, so it's soup or a jacket potato and beans then! So much nicer to spend £20 and buy a decent meal from one of the many eateries in T5 instead. Then onto the plane which was tired. As usual, bits of all 4 of our seats were broken. My wife's tv. My sound only worked in the left ear. A really dirty blanket (and no spares at all). Very late food service. But to be fair, and for a change, the stewardesses weren't their usual BA indifferent style but fairly good and certainly polite. But this is business class, and it certainly doesnt feel like it any more. I try to support British jobs, but Emirates is cheaper and better."

The aircraft interior in very good condition with clean new leather seats and the new lighting that was left on a blue light mood, same for the washrooms with the nice touch given to floor reproducing a parquet. The experience with the ground staff at Linate, left something to be desired as the staff members seemed quite annoyed with their job and not so helpful; once we checked our bags, they didn't give us no further information about where are located the security control nor about the gate to follow.  T5 staff very friendly and helpful. T5 was very clean but a bit too crowded. Fast and efficient baggage reclaim."

Flight was chockers. We were delayed taking off by an hour due to problems with French Air Traffic Control testing a new computer system. I had onward connection to Hong Kong which was already tight, told the crew, they responded promptly, and I was met at Heathrow with a luminescent envelope which gave me priority through security (I just made the connection). Onboard the crew were upbeat and attentive, the snack was fine, some sort of chicken roll and a very good coffee and chocolate cake. I guess it was the last flight of the day, so it had that lovely end of term feel about it, everyone was relaxed despite the delay. I think people are a bit hard on BA, they're not flash but for short hops anyway they get the job done."

As a loyal British Airways customer for 20 years, I have noticed wide variations in the type of flight attendant service and meal/beverage service provided on longhaul flights. BA's longhaul Club World  seat is showing its age compared to the competition, but I like the seat cushion. Having to jump over someone's feet to access a window seat is not ideal. AVOD quality varies depending on the type and age of the aircraft, and storage space for small items also varies. Service onboard was good from BAH to LHR, and meal service was good, despite cost-cutting at BA being evident in recent years. The washrooms were reasonable, but not up to the standard of competitors. The flight was on time, and my bags transferred at LHR to my next flight to the USA."

Unfortunately, the incompetent staff at the check in desk informed me that the flight is Closed and no more check ins. I knew this was incorrect, and asked for the Supervisor, who knew that the flight, being at least 1 hour late departure (2.5hrs as it turned out) is not closed! We were checked in of course! BA - please train your check in staff or fire the incompetent ones. Luckily, as a very frequent flyer, I was not going to accept the nonsense of the first check in who suggested we should fly in the evening?"

She radioed another member of staff to ask if we were to be allowed to come on the flight in an extremely moody manner, trying to have us not admitted (even though 45 minutes is the amount of time to arrive before from their website). Eventually we were allowed and with one last scowl from the staff left the desk. We got through security rushing as we thought we must be really late only to find the plane delayed for an hour."

The staff in Club World were all male and mature, and delivered an excellent service. British Airways seating arrangement in Club World is looking increasingly outdated, but a less than half full cabin meant that one was less bothered by one's neighbours. Food was reasonable, although it was surprising how quickly menu options ran out. IFE had a good selection of films, but the resolution of the screens is poor. No queues at border control and priority baggage handling meant that we were in our taxi within 20 minutes of leaving the plane."

Needless to say, no advance notice of this was give,n and by the admission of their own staff  British Airways management just don't care what impact this will have on customers who have paid a great deal of money to fly premium class. Based on our recent flights with BA where we have witnessed penny pinching devaluation of the business class experience, to the extent that there is now no comparison with other similarly priced airlines. Their cavalier approach to customer care may result in others like us saying last time with BA ever!"
1203,Julie Johnston (United Kingdom) 22nd January 2016,1/10,"""great at helping us""","My son and I flew British Airways from Glasgow to Paris on the 7th January and returned on the 11th. On out outward journey, the London flight was cancelled, so there was a knock on with our Paris flight. We did get to London, the staff were great at helping us transfer to the 5B terminal to get the flight to Paris. But I noticed that by the time we would get to Paris, we would have missed the last shuttle bus to Disney. I mentioned this to the crew, who were very good at helping, realising that I was travelling with a young adult with learning disabilities. During the flight, one member of crew kept me updated. THere were some BA managers onboard as passengers. Before we landed, he came back and told me that one of the managers would get us through to the taxis and explain to the driver where we were going and ask for a receipt. (My french is minimal, so I'd have been lost) The manager told me to keep our boarding passes and receipt amd claim BA for the taxi. My son and i had a great weekend, got home and a couple of days later, I claimed for a refund. Alas, the computer said a big fat no. It was just bad luck that we'd had to rebook flights I explained that it was a BA manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to actually find out who flew on the flight. But still, no. Our insurance won't pay either because we didn't have a long enough delay! Ok, legally, BA may be in the right, but morally, well. Even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway. After all, we were delayed due to a cancelled flight - their fault. Usually BA are brilliant when we fly with them and I cannot fault any of the frontline staff. Just that blooming computer. So I am 80 euros down on the taxi and 32 euros for a transfer I couldn't use."

Onboard, the evening meal was fine, but the inflight entertainment choices are very poor. Films, TV and music choices are limited. Cabin crew were courteous and served one drink and then dinner - but no more service after that. Overnight no water was offered, we had to keep getting up to go and ask, and then only got small measures not bottles. Breakfast choice was fair but the food was awful! Luke warm gunge, cheap cereal, tepid tea - truly not worth bothering with. I believe this is usual as my brother had similar experience a month ago flying business class from Mexico. I will think twice about booking British Airways again if I have a choice."
1205,J Goulding (United Kingdom) 19th January 2016,4/10,"""zero customer service skills""","This was the return leg of our British Airways flight on BA056 from Johannesburg to London Heathrow on 18th January. While the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly, it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody, petulant crew member. She is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. British Airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. Is this really the way BA wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little. After all, isn't it us, the customers, who choose to fly with you and support you as an airline. Check in crew at Johannesburg could also do with training on manners and smiling - instead of zero greeting, no ""thank you's"" and blank faces."

When I headed out to the galley to grab a single-malt scotch mid-way through the flight to UK, no problems at all. On the return flight, I had the best fillet of beef I have ever been given in an aircraft, and the red wine served with it complemented it nicely. All aircraft were in good shape: the announcements from the flight deck kept us informed, and the flights and landings were smooth. The transit through Heathrow Terminal 5 was hassle-free (although I did deliberately choose to fly on Sunday both ways), and my bags made it through with me (although the connecting time on the return flight was reduced to just over an hour because of the late arrival of the domestic flight). One of the best sets of flights I have ever experienced: in fact, I have written to BA to thank all the crews involved."

On the way out thre were trim bits loose inside the cabin giving the impression of bad care.

I was promised by ground staff the bags would be quicker to the aircraft than I would, again this was a lie. 24 hours later my bags haven't arrived, and are now in some office somewhere in San Francisco. Other than that I have no idea where they are.  British Airways customer service line is next to useless, with employees that do not understand English and read from a script."

Catalin-Alexandru Epure (Germany) 11th January 2016",5/10,"""would fly them again""","London to San Francisco with British Airways was a pleasant experience. We left with a slight delay due to the traffic at Heathrow (although boarded on time) but landed almost on time. We flew an A380 and my seat was somewhere in the back on the upper deck. Enough legroom, entertainment system personalized and very easy to use. Although it was a day-flight we got additional to the usual blanket and pillow, a small toothbrush and paste. The food was good (served 2 times plus snack) and so was the Spanish wine they gave us. I enjoyed the complementary drinks, alcoholic or non-alcoholic. The crew were nice and polite and careful with our needs. Some of them were even wearing Santa Claus hats making Christmas feel like home. I would fly them again, not only for the tea they serve."
1211,Ian Taylor (United Kingdom) 10th January 2016,8/10,"""where have standards gone?""","Copenhagen to London on a very full plane, with British Airways staff not limiting cabin baggage. Some people boarding with 4 bags + overcoats led to overloaded bins. Crew frantically trying to move bags to any spare space in and around seats. My nicely pressed suit jacket rammed into a gap by a staff member ended up like a J-cloth. People using their laptops throughout take off and landing despite announcements to the contrary. Ran out of drinks and ice, so no drink on a 2 hour flight. Where have the standards gone? Have raised this with British Airways but no satisfactory response after 4 weeks."

Upgraded on return flights to Premium Economy. Awful flight with crew who spent their time in a huddle discussing their party times in Las Vegas. Dreadful food, broken seat and the entertainment system froze. Not sure I'd ever fly British Airways unless there was no choice!"
1213,Michael Ingram (United Kingdom) 10th January 2016,3/10,"""really slipping down""","British Airways from Bangkok to London Heathrow, and BA is really slipping down the quality standards. With these tired old Boeing 777's, business class is pretty poor. No usb sockets, poor IFE screens and power sockets that cannot be used with British plugs! Thin contents for the amenity bag and tired seating really shows up against the competition."
1214,David Jackson (Saudi Arabia) 9th January 2016,7/10,"""seats generally okay""","British Airways from London Heathrow to Jeddah, took off over one hour late due to an unspecified technical issue. Economy section full. Seats generally okay, 7 inch screen provides a small selection of videos and music on demand. Food was some kind of chicken curry with a salted chocolate caramel mousse plus a roll and cheese. Close to arrival they offered a cheese croissant plus additional drinks. Alcohol available for free until around Egypt. One serious cleaning issue under seat 34c where the side of the computer box looked like it had never been cleaned hence food detritus had built up. Pleasant crew, just one extended message which was non safety related which could have been omitted."

Disappointed understates our reaction. Our seats were not comfortable business class as I remember, but exactly the same as the uncomfortable economy class seats behind us, distinguished only by a curtain defining where economy class finished and business started! British Airways standards are slipping!"
1216,Leigh Moore (United Kingdom) 8th January 2016,1/10,"""abyssal customer service""","London to New York JFK with British Airways, and abyssal customer service. Onboard the flight can be great, and it's the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. However, this time the onboard service was as bad as the ground service. Food was poor. I was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers, and yet my food choice was gone. The TV's didn't work in 2 seats - I couldn't be bothered to try a third and decided to just get some sleep. The staff insisted on forming a cliquish huddle and were speaking so loudly I couldn't even sleep with ear plugs in."
1217,S Bird (United Kingdom) 8th January 2016,3/10,"""it's disappointing""","British Airways from Houston from London Heathrow in premium economy. The seats could recline a lot and were quite large. However the TV screens were beyond small. It looked like ones from 2002 were better. There was virtually no difference in food to economy (except you had more than two choices), and champagne was served before and after takeoff in glasses. But after 10 hours the seat becomes very uncomfortable as you cannot lift the armrests away, because the tray table and remote are stationed in there. This made sleeping hard. Don't fly premium economy British Airways, it's disappointing."
1218,Claudiu Savulescu (Romania) 7th January 2016,6/10,"""service was good""","I flew British Airways from Bucharest to London Heathrow return, with A320 and A321 on return. The service was good, meals okay, good staff. The return flight was 100% full and we were forced to check in hand luggage, which was rather strange. The flight from London Heathrow was not on time. It had a 30 minutes delay. Overall, the best experience for the amount of money required on Bucharest-London route."
1219,Mike Palmer (Canada) 7th January 2016,8/10,"""questioning my loyalty ""","Avios points flight to London from Toronto for Christmas in Business class. Slow queue for check in though given flying just Christmas there were a lot of people and luggage to be fair. The BA club lounge at Pearson remains well run and clean. Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. Onboard, the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity kit - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with drinks served first. The evening meal was average at best and overcooked, with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece, you can see the cuts and money saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now - the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger, no flower in the toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment choices. Crew were the usual indifferent long haul ""I'm here as a favour to you all"" with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service! I think the main problem British Airways have is a dated cabin product. The ying yang seating in it's day was innovative and one of the first lay flat beds. Now, crawling over a stranger to reach the isle, being bumped by people and carts if you're on the aisle, and a lack of storage space mean that the BA product is way inferior to Air Canada and a lot of the middle eastern carriers. My loyalty is now being tested and with the constant devaluing of the Executive Club benefits including mileage flight availability and cost I am now questioning my loyalty to British Airways."
1220,Paige Marshall (United Kingdom) 4th January 2016,5/10,"""gave their friends first class champagne""","My partner and I traveled British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana on 29th December. After checking in online and paying an extra £45 each way per person to reserve seats after already paying over £4000 for our flights (wasn't a major issue and was expected), we discovered that selecting our outgoing seats was fine, but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin. Being a nervous flyer I was not up for sitting by myself for nearly 9 hours so we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage drop off point, the gentleman working behind the drop off was as helpful as he could be, but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left Punta Cana, and that it wasn't likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers. Getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane, with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay, flight attendants then offered us drinks - once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for and we were happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. But then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staff's family were on board and they were all staying in Punta Cana for 5 days before flying home. One member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class - and walked past everybody else. My partner then asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them. When we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water. 1 hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. All staff in our cabin looked half asleep, with hair all over the place. Considering this was a 2pm flight you'd have thought it was an evening flight. We arrived in Punta Cana at 7pm extremely disapointed with the poor service and the dated plane we had endured for almost 9 hours."
1221,John Davey (United Kingdom) 2nd January 2016,1/10,"""a very poor experience""","London to Johannesburg return with British Airways. This was my first ever long haul flight to see my daughter get married in Zimbabwe. I was in for a big shock and not a nice one. The seats and room were not really any different to low cost airlines and this was an 11 hour flight - jammed in like sardines and got no sleep. Freezing cold aircon all the way back from Johannesburg, and again so cramped that when the person in front of you puts the seat back, you cannot eat your food. I used a connecting flight to Bulawayo which was with South African Airlink and even though it was only a 1 hour flight, the food was much better and the plane far more comfortable. A very poor experience with British Airways and GBP 4000 spent for the 3 of us to get there and back. I will never be disapointed with Ryanair or easyjet again. British Airways  are trading on their name only."

This was my first flight on British Airways from Vancouver to Lisbon via London. I selected it because of price. Overall experience was adequate. Plane was an older B747 and interior showed its age. IFE was outdated. Seat comfort was fine. Cabin crew not attentive between meals. Western food offerings just ok. Had several hours layover at Heathrow. British Airways ground staff good and pleasant. I might fly British Airways again if equipment is updated to A380 or Boeing 787 and price is lowest to Europe."

Ground staff most helpful, lounge impressive. Cabin crew friendly and attentive, food was good, unfortunately, the seats were a bit outdated for 2015 and desperately need to be upgraded. Flight was delayed by a bug in the entertainment system, which was fixed promptly and the Captain made up for lost time. All in all, it was a good flight."

Lounges at Madrid Barajas T4 and Heathrow T5 excellent, but overcrowded and a bit frayed at the edges at Los Angeles. No problems with baggage or delays. The Boeing 767s used between London and Madrid are so old they're almost retro, with LED screen TVs and blue leather seats, but comfortable, spacious and clean. The A380s seemed almost new, the seats are a little narrow but comfortable, and the inflight entertainment is excellent. Good amenity kit and simple but good quality food. It's nice that they serve traditional British things like brunch and afternoon tea, and they offer excellent wines and drinks. Nice cosmopolitan mix of friendly, professional and attentive cabin crew on all flights."
1225,C Walker (United Kingdom) 1st January 2016,9/10,"""the worst business class""","Copenhagen to Chicago via London Heathrow. British Airways club world is the worst business class cabin I've flown. TVs are tiny and the picture quality is awful - thankfully I had my laptop with me, as the TV was unwatchable. The tables hang at an angle, so expect your food and drink to slide off (although the floor is probably the best place for their food). I would advise you to eat at the airport and not rely on the inflight slop.  You'll have someone climbing over you (or you'll have to climb over other people) to get to the toilet (this is business class!).  And then they'll lose your bag, tell you it's going to take 4-5 days to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime. If you try and call to get answers, leave at least 45 minutes time to sit in a queue (and then expect to be put through to the wrong person, despite selecting the correct option in the automated menu!). Avoid British Airways wherever you can!"

R Simon (Austria) 30th December 2015",1/10,"""only book BA if lowest fare""","British Airways from Vienna to Newcastle via Heathrow return, flights on-time. Economy on an A320. FA’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on VIE legs the FA’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. Information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. A snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the VIE flights and crisps/biscuits on the NCL flights. Additional drinks on request. A320 featured the new slim seats and I miss the older more comfortable BA seats with better leg room. BA has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). If one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR 75 at the airport or EUR 35 online. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. So, BA became a low cost model, except for drinks service. However the prices do not reflect this change in service. On the last leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was heavily policed. Although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous BA flights, I was required to check it in. It was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. Hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. However, here goes the main advantage of BA, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. Boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. Instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. Another thing is, that recent changes in BA’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly Club on long distance routes. Obviously, BA is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. While I stopped flying Business with BA probably a year ago after they downgraded their Club Europe cabin and I was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, I believe BA’s European economy was a great product and I was using BA regularly for those flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book BA if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. For flights to the UK, KLM starts to look pretty good again."
1227,J Fairclough (France) 30th December 2015,5/10,"""cost no more than Ryanair""","London Heathrow to Barcelona, and for some reason British Airways continue to run this Barcelona service from the dated Terminal 3 at Heathrow, rather than new T5. That apart, this service was fine. Boarding was quick and efficient. Seats in Economy are now pretty similar to those on low cost airlines. But this handluggage only ticket cost no more than one with Ryanair from Stansted would have. Food and drink was the now standard minimalist option on most European flights these days. Just one question - why, when this is the British national flag-carrier, does the drinks trolley not stock some British beer, rather than identikit continental fizzy lagers? Departure and arrival in BCN was on schedule, and exiting the airport a breeze."
1228,Rob Jacobs (United Kingdom) 28th December 2015,7/10,"""sad to see the same old planes ""","London to Newcastle. Been a while since I last flew British Airways, sad to see the same old planes in use and now very much looking their age for domestic use. Technical issues delayed departure, normal sure, but the noise the plane made on taxi lasted far too long and was slightly alarming and not the norm. Seat pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely? Last time flown I got a nice sandwich and drink, this time it's small bag of crisps and juice? It's time BA stopped taking it's domestic (no competition routes) for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trips, the numbers onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fees now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on, puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for how long now? Kudos to the pilot for landing in Monsoon like conditions with very limited visibility - if only the aircraft quality matched their pilots!"

After waiting on hold to complain to a supervisor for over 20 mins, we still didn't get to discuss why it takes so long for a refund? I phoned on another mobile and was told no supervisor was available! If ever you need help don't bother with British Airways."
1231,A Bhatia (United States) 18th December 2015,1/10,"""we are disappointed""","Phoenix to London Heathrow, and this was our third time flying First Class on British Airways, and after flying this time, we are disappointed.  The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20 minutes. Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if I can find some biscuits for you"". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American accent for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. Toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical First Class amenities available within the toilets. Our next leg was within EU to Munich on another BA flight where the service on a 737 surpassed their international First Class! Seat is comfortable but that's about it!"

1233,D Goodman-Anders (United Kingdom) 16th December 2015,9/10,"""seat very comfortable""","We flew GRU-LHR on the upper deck in seats 63AB in business class. We were able to use the new TAM lounge at terminal 3 GRU, this was an amazing lounge, huge, lots of food and drink on offer, showers, sleeping area, lots of seating. I was apprehensive about the seating plan on BA with the reverse seat by the window and the aisle facing forward. Travelling as a couple, this seating actually works really well, it's good to be able to chat with each other throughout the flight and is much better than the Herringbone seating - that being said if you are travelling alone I can understand why it may not be preferable. Offered champagne on boarding, before dinner further drinks service. The food was excellent which included dinner and breakfast prior to arrival. The seat was very comfortable, full flat bed, the only problem I found was being 6ft 1in, my feet touched the wall at the end and I couldn't fully stretch out but this did not prevent me sleeping. Upon arrival at Heathrow, the luggage was coming around the carousel by the time I got there, which was only about 10-15 mins after disembarkation. My only complaint I could find was the Entertainement was slightly limited, and there was no USB to charge my phone, but this is an older aircraft."

1236,Brian Park (United Kingdom) 16th December 2015,7/10,"""service very good and friendly""","Third time flying the British Airways A380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration. A question for BA: We really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using BA? I do not mean cost."

Cabin crew were off hand. The in flight snack was thrown at rather served to passengers. The totally inedible ""sandwiches"" offered consisted of rubbery processed cheese between two thick slices of poor quality bread. The one consolation was that the flight lasted just less than two hours."

I have got used to the rather warn and used state of the Club World cabin in BA’s 777 and 747. This one appeared very clean and smart. The seats we find comfortable and enjoy the ying yang seating for couples travelling together. We found food to be very good for the two meals we were served. The final comment is that the staff appeared to be friendlier and more enthusiastic about their jobs. We found the staff on the flight home in Club were friendly and attentive.

Seats in Club Europe are comfortable. IFE is not available, except for viewing the route displayed on LCD maps. Cabin crew were attentive and quick in offering drinks and meals. On the flight back, I really a tasty prawn salad served with white wine or champagne. Perfect punctuality and smooth boarding. I would definitely fly again and recommend them."
1246,E Davis-Bennett (United States) 10th December 2015,9/10,"""BA really did not care""","I have flown British Airways Business Class and was pleased with Lounge, food service, Elemis Spa, showers wit Elemis products and on request champagne. Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. My review is for First only."
1247,Tim Farr (United Kingdom) 9th December 2015,3/10,"""relaxing and luxurious""","Fantastic flight in Club World with British Airways from London Gatwick to Punta Cana. On time departure from Gatwick on a 777-200 - it's true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin, but seats 2A and 2B were comfortable and functioning perfectly. Greeted by friendly mixed-fleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off. Prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices. I enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad, followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty. The delicious Castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so I recommend ordering this promptly. As this was a leisure flight, all champagne did run out about 3 hours in, for which the crew apologised sincerely, but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent Chablis and Medoc. The Club Kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help. Plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing. Bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly. The entertainment system was great in Club with a decent selection of new release films, though the screen resolution could be better, especially Wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full. We were kept well informed of the flight progress throughout by a cheery and personable First Officer, who navigated a mean-looking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb. All in all this was a relaxing and luxurious way to begin our holiday and a great to example of BA at their best."
1248,D Marsh (United Kingdom) 9th December 2015,9/10,"""very friendly crew""","LGW to TPA with British Airways. Boeing 777-200 was an older aircraft but clean, very friendly crew, all smiles and helpful. Food was ok, three different choices, though sadly ran out of red wine mid flight. Seat ok for economy apart from the woman in front of me who must have thought she was in Club and kept trying to recline her seat into a flat bed."
1249,Andrew Allen (United Kingdom) 8th December 2015,7/10,"""unlimited legroom and a speedy exit""","Heathrow to Cape Town with British Airways. I was aware that the 747 is past it's best but I had two wonderful flights due mainly to the superb service from cabin crew, who are better than any other airline I have travelled. I did however have maybe the best seats ie 28b and 28j in the entire economy section which give unlimited legroom and a speedy exit. The food was extremely good with dinner and breakfast served. The toilets were spotless."
1250,Kevin Barrance (United Kingdom) 1st December 2015,5/10,"""staff bordering on rude""",Flew to Kuala Lumpur with British Airways on an old Boeing 777-200 in business class (upgrade) which was OK although choice of IFE very poor. Crew pleasant but not particularly efficient and since my wife and I were seated together in the middle rear-facing seats it is an odd practice to serve us separately - her meals were served well before mine. Flight was punctual and we had a few hours sleep. Coming back was in Premium Economy and might as well have been on a different airline. Same old plane with TV screens extremely small. Meals not particularly great. The main difference is that British Airways crew treat anybody flying in a lower class as lesser individuals and they are bordering on rude. They forget that whatever class of cabin you are flying in that you are the customer and pay their wages. Next time Malaysia Airlines I think.
1251,Nadia Ramia (United States) 1st December 2015,5/10,"""flights therefore very uncomfortable""","Washington to Dubai via London return with British Airways. My concern is regarding seat allocation. When we booked our flight (2 adults, one child and one infant), the seats with the bassinets for the infants were not available. We then chose 3 seats together on the side. I presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the needs of the passengers that are traveling with children. Nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats were taken by single individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. I asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". That was not the case, unfortunately. The flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. I do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. British Airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. The priority seating chart is for that purpose useful."
1252,Paul Cartwright (United Kingdom) 1st December 2015,6/10,"""pleasantly surprised""","Pleasantly surprised with my British Airways return flights from Edinburgh to Las Vegas via LHR. Great crew on the outward flight and whilst we were in economy we were treated to champagne to celebrate a fiftieth birthday and offered the usual complimentary drinks. Two hot meals outbound were tasty. Return also fine but dinner was a bit dodgy, chicken gnocchi allegedly but hot breakfast compensated for this. Although the flights were full it was quiet and managed to get some sleep. Only slight criticism is the in flight entertainment. Not much of a selection in comparison to other airlines."
1253,P Herman (United Kingdom) 1st December 2015,8/10,"""vegetarian salad was welcome""","We boarded and arrived to destination late (30 minutes) but inflight experience was nearly flawless. Cabin seemed to have some mood lighting, comfortable leather seats with headrest, and enough legroom. Crew pleasant and hardworking, they spoke to passengers with onward connections about the state of their flight. Vegetarian salad was welcome, as was the small bottle of wine.  It certainly wasn't the cheapest flight but I noticed the difference."
1254,Peter Ingham (United Kingdom) 30th November 2015,9/10,"""miserable Business Class experience""","My wife and I flew British Airways from Heathrow to Istanbul, Business Class (supposedly!), on an A320. We found our seats to be both hard and uncomfortable with minimal legroom and the hot meal provided, breakfast in our case, was dire. The toilet at the front of the aircraft was so unbelievably small as to be difficult to use. We consider that the conditions we had to put up with were quite unsuitable for a four hour flight. I am puzzled why British Airways would choose to offer such a miserable Business Class experience, it would be more honest and cause less disappointment if they were to declare all their European A320 flights to be economy only."
1255,Lynn Ting (United Kingdom) 30th November 2015,3/10,"""British Airways have lost the plot""","I think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The London to Barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. It started at Grantley Adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. We sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so I had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. There were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents I would presume. Next the food, abysmal! A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). Breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. I have travelled with British Airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from Singapore and Malaysia with British Airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. The cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. I asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. I did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance. British Airways have lost the plot and are up against great airlines such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines, although sadly not on the Barbados route."
1256,A Sommerville (United Kingdom) 29th November 2015,3/10,"""aircraft are old and shabby""","Glasgow to Bangkok via Heathrow with British Airways. We never received ""paid for seats"" that we have just had £160.00 refunded back on to my credit card after complaining that we never on both legs of our flights. We had been told that we would not get refund as we had assistance? I e-mail them and informed I had my e-mail confirmation of set numbers and payment and seat ticket subs to prove my claim and at no point did I ask for or need or receive any assistance. They back tracked and I was informed my claim was authorised and it would take 6/8 weeks. British Airways need to stop this practice as it does not show the Airline in a good light. I would be wary of using British Airways long haul again, the aircraft are too old and shabby, and the female stewardess need to go back on a training course on customer service. Spirit of service what happened to that."
1257,P O'Sullivan (United Kingdom) 29th November 2015,4/10,"""the food was shocking""","London Heathrow to Brisbane via Singapore return with British Airways. Overall it was not a great experience. We upgraded to premium economy on the way back expecting better leg room but I hardly noticed a difference! The plane looks old and the food was shocking! They advertise that there are great chefs picking the meals but the breakfast consisted of what I presume was a sausage and some type of scrambled egg, it was not nice. The flight did not take off for an hour because the entertainment system was faulty. The entertainment was ok, however the music could do with updating. The staff were friendly and it was easy checking in."

Sadly British Airways seems to have it's most rude and arrogant staff on flights to India, who treat passengers poorly and don't really care. Flew MAN-LHR-BOS return last month and the staff on those flights seemed to be much better. Same with the food - food on the flight to and from India wasn't great - I asked for a specific meal on the outward journey which wasn't there and was instead there on the return leg - which I did not need. When I queried this - the answer was ""You must have made a mistake"" and the attitude was of a ""take it or leave it""."

Craig Cutts (United Kingdom) 23rd November 2015",5/10,"""service pretty good""","London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, checked in on line with only hand luggage, used the app to download the boarding pass so through security and to the BA Galleries North Lounge which was packed but had a good spread of breakfast. Boarding from Gate A8 onto a Boeing 767 which appeared pretty old and not very clean, but fine for a 1hr 20min flight. A hot breakfast served which was nice, the flight was only half full. Return the BA app refused to work so checked in at the airport, quick security quick and had time in the Galleries lounge. A newish A320, seat 2F which was fine with the aircraft an all economy layout. During the 1hr flight served a coffee and snack. Service pretty good, and I guess there is no other option these days apart from BA."
1261,Amanda Edgar (United Kingdom) 22nd November 2015,7/10,"""crew competent and approachable""","Took my daughter to Dubai for some R and R, Heathrow check in quick as was security. The lounge at T5 looked liked a war zone, dirty glasses and plates scattered everywhere. We entered at 5:30pm and the only food available was sandwiches, very poor decided to wait till the dinner service on board, good drinks selection. Boarded and soon seated with a glass of bubbles, the crew for a change were competent and approachable on both legs but slightly more mature. To be honest don't have a problem with BA but find they are lagging behind other major airlines whose lounges and service is far superior!"
1262,Michael Orshan (United States) 21st November 2015,7/10,"""this policy is ridiculous""","I have booked a flight to travel with my wife from the USA to Italy. I booked this trip through American Airlines, and some of the flights are with British Airways. In order to select seats on British Airways, I have to pay about $200 for the both of us, maybe more. I will never fly American Airlines or British Airways ever again. I think this policy is ridiculous."
1263,Richard Hodges (United Kingdom) 20th November 2015,1/10,"""comfortable, if narrow, seats""","British Airways from Tampa to Gatwick on Boeing 777 Club World. Having travelled out WT Plus to Miami we got a good deal coming back from Tampa so flew Club Class. Checked in at Tampa with no queues, and used the International Lounge at Tampa. Supposed to be exclusive to BA customers this had comfortable seats, and good choice of newspapers and magazines. Did not try WiFi. However, there was disappointingly very poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches which were not replenished during my time there, and crackers with some processed cheese with a few dips, some wine, beer, liquor and soft drinks. Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board comfortable, if narrow, seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds. British Airways still have the very camped 2-4-2 layout with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the rest room etc. Reasonable meal (beef) accompanied by an outstanding Chablis Premier Cru and a very nice Sauvignon Blanc. My wife slept for 5 straight hours - I could only sleep fitfully as not much room at shoulder level but at least the seats were comfortable. Terrible selection of films on the entertainment system. Took off on time, and landed slightly early. FA's quite smiley and nice."
1264,Trevor Slade (Italy) 20th November 2015,8/10,"""inconsistency with cabin crew""","I have used British Airways on a regular basis between Rome and Gatwick. My flights have usually been on time, most aircraft do not have the new interior, a few with bmi screens at the door. I always order AVML meals which are good quality for dinner, but plain cheese, cucumber and tomoato sandwiches for afternoon tea. My issue is the inconsistency with the cabin crew who can vary from pleasant to rude and cut corners with the service when they can. I appreciate that the LGW base is a ""low cost"" base for BA, but there is no excuse for the crew to behave as they do. easyJet and Vueling crew look more professional and are more pleasant on the same route. The LGW lounge is tired and average at best. It needs a good clean. FCO still has no lounge after the fire in the summer nor have any other arrangements been made. Flying in and out of LGW with BA you are aware that this is not the real BA and is downgraded in all ways from LHR."
1265,Richard Hodges (United Kingdom) 20th November 2015,6/10,"""crummy Boeing 747s""","London Heathrow to Miami on one of British Airways crummy Boeing 747s. Originally Booked WT Plus choosing flight in an A380 with shiny new updated cabin and entertainment system for 3rd year in a row, and for the 3rd year in a row they promptly changed the plane on my flight for a very elderly and not updated Boeing 747. Do BA actually have any A380's? Reasonably comfortable, but the old on demand entertainment system had a poor choice of films and programs. Cabin staff and food okay from memory but, as usual with British Airways nowadays, very small portions. Took off slightly late in fog, made up time on flight and landed slightly early at Miami. Old aircraft notwithstanding I still think WT Plus is well worth the extra - 7 inches of extra legroom is so much more comfortable than coach."
1266,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 18th November 2015,6/10,"""return trip not worth it""","Checked in and found the Club lounge was ""landside"" meaning one had to allow time to get through security after using it. I need not have worried as I spent all of 60 seconds in the shared lounge that British Airways use with about eight airlines. As BA have 3 daily flights to Hannover and potentially 60+ users of the facility, I could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around. Wrong! The meal was a bunch of dried up sausages in a steamer that looked like samples in a medical lab. Ghastly. A few bits of cheese here and there and that was it. I quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the Movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  Only three passenger in Club and the plane pushed back 5 minutes early. The meal I was offered was a reasonable looking prawn salad. I declined as I was well fed. A couple of Gin and Tonics and the flight of 90 minutes passed easily. FAs very friendly. Landing was in high winds and very well executed. Was the return trip worth it for £800? Not really but then my client paid the bill."
1267,Patrick Moore (Ireland) 18th November 2015,3/10,"""not received a refund""","Dublin to London City on 2nd November flight was cancelled due to fog, queued for 3 hours for a rebooking only to be offered a flight on the following evening when fog was due again in London. Refund could not be processed by staff in the airport so I had to phone the call centre. Two weeks later and I still have not received a refund. Booked Ryanair for the following day and even though it was last minute, it was still cheaper than my original cancelled BA flight. Reluctant to pay a premium to fly British Airways again."
1268,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 18th November 2015,2/10,"""dried up sandwich""","Trip got off to a good start with the Club lounge at Terminal 3, and I prefer it to T5. Decent seating. Reasonable food and plenty of drinks.  Plane was newish and in good shape. Was seated in 1A so leg room was fine. Anywhere else in Club Europe is a waste of time and little space. Plane took off 40 minutes late. FAs were fine. Declined the miserable, pathetic looking dried up sandwich which was the inflight meal. Had a couple of Gin and Tonics instead. Comfortable flight of about 80 minutes."
1269,Sylvia Goddard (United Kingdom) 18th November 2015,3/10,"""out of date with modern standards""","This review covers my usual return trip from London Heathrow to Dubai. Both flights are overnight and I use points to upgrade to business. It was a Boeing 777 going out and Boeing 747 on the return trip. There was nothing really wrong with either flight but I only really use them for the timings and the flat bed to get some sleep. I don't like the weird front to back 2x4x2 layout and cannot forsee how much longer British Airways can get away with this as it is so out of date with modern standards. It is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you. Having watched the seating pattern filling up over several months I eventually paid £136 extra to reserve a window seat both ways. After a couple of hours the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent. That said, the crew were polite and served well. They seemed to be older and I think that makes the difference, they understand customer service. On the return, one cabin crew in particular was very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated and this time the service was good. It got me there and back safely and I was fed and watered. I am very open to moving my custom elsewhere though, primarily due to the seat layout."
1270,A Boyle (United Kingdom) 14th November 2015,5/10,"""just did not care at all""","Flight and crew great, the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. Total nightmare and they just did not care at all. Our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. When arriving at Orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. We noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry, as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem. The staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby. Even though these seats are reserved for people with babies due to the bassinet availability. Eventually it was changed back after so much stress and hassle. On returning we complained and 3 times we got the answer yes it was our fault we are sorry but we can't give anything to say sorry for our behaviour. Eventually after another complaint they agreed to 3000 avios and £25 voucher. I won't be flying with British Airways again as they are so bad in customer relations and check in agents leave a lot to be desired."
1271,H Singh (United Kingdom) 14th November 2015,4/10,"""farcical flight to be honest""","Heathrow to Las Vegas with British Airways, and a farcical flight to be honest. 2 hours into a 10 hour flight running out of beer for those who drink is a joke. Not having the choice of food by the time it comes to you on 4 occasions over the 2 flights is pathetic - I guess you need to really consider where you book your seats by asking where they start serving from. I thought air stewardesses were meant to at least crack a smile once and again, and when asked reasonable questions (that had to be asked due to the ridiculous shortages) were meant to be as accommodating and friendly as possible? Hope I never have to fly with British Airways again."

A horrible, tiny, dry bread bun with a the smallest piece of chicken ever and the most salty bacon I have ever tasted. The best part was the sticky bun that followed, washed down with lemonade. No entertainment for this 1hr 45min flight. The toilets were barely passable, had they been cleaned from the previous flight?"
1273,Peter Meikle (United Kingdom) 13th November 2015,3/10,"""so much cabin baggage""","Gatwick to Venice with British Airways. The plane was clean, crew good and reasonably on time, with good check in. But the flight was made unpleasant by BA encouraging people to take so much cabin baggage on to the plane. The return flight was perhaps 80% full, but the overhead lockers were full. It causes a scrum at boarding. The back row passengers board first and stowed their cases at the front so they don't have to carry them down the plane. The lockers are than full when the forward rows boarded they had nowhere to stow theirs. It was then chaos while the cabin crew sorted it out. It should be every passengers right to not have luggage under their feet."
1274,L Aritonang (United Kingdom) 12th November 2015,5/10,"""really below average""","Round trip London to Luanda in British Airways business class (Club World). It's really below average. British Airways seems stand still in the competition with other airlines. The seats are cramped. There are no storage for personal items. The seats and toilets were not adequately cleaned up after previous flight. The food and IFE were average for business class. British Airways should think about improving the cabin in general or otherwise they will continue to fall behind their competitors. Even American Airlines and Iberia, which practically owned by same company, have improved a lot. The only positive thing was the FAs in both legs were polite and courteous. They were relatively young so they still have motivation to do their jobs."
1275,Nima Ghaemi (United Kingdom) 12th November 2015,5/10,"""interior very old and dirty""","Not impressed with British Airways at all. We flew back from Denver after visiting family. We flew out with Lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the Middle/Far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. Our return Lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at Lufthansa. We were booked straight on to the BA flight back to London which left only an hour later. Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. Their Boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. Stick to an airline you know well, Lufthansa are the best European airline all round that I have used, and Emirates was the best internationally. I hope this review was helpful - obviously I am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses, however be aware when booking with British Airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money."
1276,Stephen Riches (Thailand) 12th November 2015,3/10,"""Business seats are horrid""","Roundtrip with British Airways from Bangkok to London in Club World. Really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. The seats are horrid. Cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. It's unbelievably cramped and when I pay more than 4x the economy ticket, I expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. The main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  The pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. Changed it for the cold King prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. The bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. Blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. Crew outbound were older and very pleasant. Inbound was a much younger crew and only one (Spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. The rest were more intent on getting to Bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. Boarding at LHR they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. The Club Word lounge meal offerings at T5 were abysmal. More like a school canteen. If anyone from BA reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful IFE. It's archaic and that's being polite. Fuzzy, small screens and if you choose a movie with subtitles, they're illegible."
1277,Jim Dennis (United Kingdom) 11th November 2015,3/10,"""awful customer service""","Awful customer service. My wife and I have flown with British Airways for almost 30 years, I booked a flight through the Executive club, which we are members of, nine months before travelling. Less than 4 weeks later we realised we would need to cancel, and after almost 1 hour on the phone on hold I decided to hang up and do it online. This seemed to be a simple process with a final message of ""we are processing your request"".  After no confirmation at all, I received my credit card statement to find a refund from BA of under £250 - my booking was over £2500. After a call to customer services I was I will not get any further refund or be able to reinstate the flights. There was nobody else to talk to, and if I emailed any of the BA executives it would be forwarded to customer services and they would not reply! I asked about ombudsman or arbitrators and was informed that British Airways does not adhere to or listen to outside bodies. Over £2100 down the pan months before take off, so plenty of time for BA to double their money on my seats. Never again!"
1278,Maureen Pratten (Australia) 10th November 2015,1/10,"""would fly them again""","I travelled from London to Sydney via Singapore in British Airways first class. I found the service outstanding, food was good lots of choices and the wine list was also good. Seat was comfortable, but the thing I would fault is that the armrest does stick in to you when in the sleep position.  Would fly them again."
1279,David Ellis (United Kingdom) 10th November 2015,9/10,"""isn't as good as Singapore and Emirates""","British Airways have just moved Cape Town flights to Terminal 3 at Heathrow and it's not a good move. The Concorde lounge at T3 is looking so shabby that it's a disgrace. Thankfully, on board in the new first class was better. The crew was young but did a good job. Seats 4E/F are good for a couple, but there's some lack of privacy. Dinner was excellent, which is down to steam ovens British Airways have finally fitted in first class galley. The combination of PJs, duvet and a 6 ft 6 flat bed meant that sleep actually occurred. The letdown was the breakfast which was mediocre as usual, although it was good tea and coffee. But, as others have said, British Airways first class just isn't as good as Singapore and Emirates."
1280,A Long (United Kingdom) 6th November 2015,5/10,"""no space to work""","I would never fly British Airways on London-Istanbul-London route again. Business class seat is awful, same as economy seat, no space to work or even space for your legs, no entertainment, no TV. BA thinks they can get away with making so much profit and ripping you off. Definitely going for Turkish Airline in the future."

Carl Fearn (Switzerland) 6th November 2015",1/10,"""courteous and professional""","Geneva to Beijing via LHR. First flights on British Airways for six years - not because I was avoiding them, I just did not fly much. Used to be a big fan of BA but recent negative reviews made me a bit nervous. Well, my experiences on board the 2 flights were excellent. Cabin Services Directors on both flights were approachable, courteous and professional and team members exemplary. The boarding in Geneva was efficient, seat was comfortable for economy class and the flight departed before time. The sandwich and drinks provided were appreciated. On time arrival in Heathrow Terminal 5. The process of getting to the Beijing flight was relatively quick. The flight to Beijing was a 3 year old Boeing 777-300 series and my seat was 37A - the emergency exit seat that quite a few people have complained about because it has no window and the emergency slide box on the door limited leg room. I am 6' 3"" tall and there was more than enough space for my long legs. Bar service offered shortly after take off. The food was good (smoked salmon starter, beef/rice dish,  chocolate orange mousse). IFE was excellent (compared to the United flights I had taken to the USA earlier in the month) with a good selection of films and TV shows. During the flight, the crew came by with trays of drinks. Breakfast was a cooked breakfast with muesli starter, orange juice and a bread roll. Coffee refills were offered. The flight landed on time. I really could not fault the planes, service or food on both flights. Economy seating is cramped these days but BA seats are no worse/no better than other airlines. The return flights to Geneva a week later were just as good."
1282,John Geoffrey Pierson (United States) 5th November 2015,10/10,"""exemplary in every way""","British Airways from London Heathrow to Nairobi return, both trips in Club World and both exemplary in every way. On time, cheerful and professional flight attendants, presentable and appealing meals, and on our return flight, which departed at 11:30 pm, a conspicuous effort to begin the meal service quickly so passengers could get to sleep quickly."
1283,David Houlihan (United Arab Emirates) 5th November 2015,10/10,"""snottiest crew I ever came across""","I am BA gold primarily due to the fact that I fly with Qatar Airways as part of oneworld. Recent flight First class from Dubai to Seattle and return first class to LHR, and business class (Club) to Abu Dhabi. Crew are great in First class on the leg to Seattle. The product is tired, the call centre is useless, on hold for over 45 minutes, messed up bookings - not good enough. Crew on return over familar in first, ground crew at Heathrow looked bored. Its the Business class seat gets me this face to face at a stranger - who designed these? I would never use it again, this shutter up and down, the snottiest crew I ever came across with a steward with an attitude problem. Food shocking in club, first was good. Great wines. Overall its tired hardware, good crew except LHR-AUH on the 31st. I suggest Willie Walsh flies Qatar Airways - that's true business class and first class."
1284,Brenda Hayden (United Kingdom) 4th November 2015,4/10,"""going back to Virgin Atlantic ""","Newark to Heathrow with British Airways. Very disappointed that I paid so much money for Premium Economy, and yet so little extra above economy class. Was in row 10 on both the outgoing and incoming (night) flights. Seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy. I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person. I had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. Never saw them again. Am definitely going back to Virgin Atlantic where Premium Economy seats are really roomy and comfortable and the staff friendly - even the ones at Newark."
1285,Kath Boddy (United Kingdom) 4th November 2015,5/10,"""dismayed by the BA agent""","Excellent flight and no complaints even though we were delayed due fog at Gatwick. The pilot kept us briefed as to what was going on and the cabin crew looked after us. I was however dismayed by the BA agent that dealt with our check in at Venice. We were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked us to go this woman, from the outset she was not happy. We were a party of 8 and she only wanted to check in 2. She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline. I feel BA need to know how their passengers are treated by agent staff. I have not included this experience in my rating of BA. Once through check-in the flight experience was excellent."
1286,Andrew MacLeod (United Kingdom) 4th November 2015,9/10,"""seats are very tired""","Return British Airways flight from Heathrow to Las Vegas. The cabin crew were very good, helpful and friendly. However, the quality of the seatback screens and the seats are very tired, and very oudated. The films and tv shows are good, however the quality of the screen is poor, compared to other airlines. The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways don't. Even other, newer, BA planes have far superior seats and VOD, to which it is shocking the difference in the service offered for economy class, there isn't even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes. At least the meals were good."
1287,Vincent Borlaug (United States) 3rd November 2015,6/10,"""cabin crew did a great job""","Lisbon to London on 2nd November was like many other flights affected by the thick fog which forced cancellation and delays of so many flights into Heathrow. The plane was boarded at normal departure time, just in case this flight got a slot into Heathrow, and kept informed of developments by the flight deck. Since at one point it appeared likely our slot might not open up till 16.00 (scheduled at 10.20) the food and drink service was started, and cabin crew did a great job keeping a congenial atmosphere in the cabin whilst doing this. Eventually we did get a slot at 14.00 and got into Heathrow round 16.30. It was quite stressful for those passengers who had connections to make (I did make my connection that afternoon to Washington), but the stress was reduced by continuous up-to-the-minute information from the flight deck and service from cabin crew."
1288,R Kohn (United States) 3rd November 2015,10/10,"""lack of service amazed me""","Philadelphia to Athens via Heathrow with British Airways. The lack of service amazed me since I have flown both first and business on many airlines. The Club World menu listed 2 Starter items, 3 Main choices, and 4 desserts. I chose the Grilled halloumi and portobello mushroom starter. If it was grilled, it must have been a long time before it was refrigerated. Not too good. The fillet was like a piece of old shoe leather. I will admit that it might be difficult to come up with a medium rare steak but this was bad. I was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. I was never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask for some. I was not offered any after dinner drink. In short, the service was rushed and more like a coach class. It appeared that the attendants were trying to get rid of us and get us to sleep rather than serve us. I was very disappointed and would avoid British Airways business class. This was on the PHL to Heathrow segment on October 26. Service on the second leg to Athens was good."
1289,R Ninikova (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2015,3/10,"""you will get value for money""","I flew with BA in September and cannot complain about anything. Everything went smoothly and cabin crew were 
nice and willing to help. Food was of expected quality for a short-haul flight. Ground service was excellent and seats were perfectly acceptable for 2 hours long flight. I use to fly with BA quite often and I never had any problem. To be fair, you cannot expect luxury of Emirates for this price, but with BA you will get value for money."
1290,Jonathon Marshall (United Kingdom) 30th October 2015,5/10,"""will use other carriers""","Checked in online prior to departure expecting to use a British Airways online check in desk or fast bag drop on arrival at Manchester Airport. BA used to have a fast bag drop desk for customers who have checked in online. When I enquired as to where it was on arrival at Manchester Airport I was directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated, ""We don't have one. You have to join the back of the queue"". In that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online?! It serves no purpose whatsoever. The shuttle down to Manchester was delayed by about an hour as was our onward flight from LHR to LAS. This flight was on one of their ancient B747-400 aircraft which was 25 years old, and it showed. The seats in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a 10.5 hour flight and there was no legroom. Inflight entertainment options were poor. I have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight. The in flight catering was mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service. Our return flight from LAS to LHR was delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from T5 at LHR I received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into T3 at LHR. As we were already delayed into LHR, by the time we had crossed to T5 our connecting flight to Manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of 26 hours by the time we got home. BA made sure our travel experience was as miserable and inconvenient as possible. I have decided after many issues of late with BA that I can no longer be bothered with the hassle. If the flights are not delayed then they usually manage to lose my luggage. I have finally had enough and will use other carriers whenever I can."
1291,M Dye (United Kingdom) 30th October 2015,1/10,"""the seat was roomy""","I recently got an unexpected upgrade to World Traveller Plus whilst on my way to New York. There was free cava before take-off and a random hot towel handed out. The seat was roomy and leg room was fantastic. Even more so because I was at the front of the World Traveller Plus cabin just after Club World, so there were no seats in front of me. Inflight entertainment was ok, but not as good as I was expecting. I did struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. I think now with early digital release of many films on things like i-Tunes, the days of being able to see really recent films on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end. As I was at the front of the cabin I had a screen that folded out of my armrest, which meant I was looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead, which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile. It was also annoying to stow away. The food was good for airline food. You get a superior meal in World Traveller Plus and it was pretty tasty and filling. The pre-landing snack wasn't up to much though. It was a dull sandwich, much like those that BA hand out on short-haul European flights. A real bonus about being in World Traveller Plus is that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit. This is useful when arriving in the US where immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. I ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue as I was so quick off the plane, which meant I was out through immigration pretty quickly. I think to pay for World Traveller Plus would be quite expensive for what you get in some respects (essentially a nicer meal and more leg room) but it was a nice treat from BA and If you were going on a super long haul flight I can definitely see the attraction."
1292,J R Garin (United Kingdom) 30th October 2015,8/10,"""FA's were happy to assist""","First ever long haul trip with British Airways as I usually fly with Cathay Pacific or KLM so I thought I'd give BA a chance. Ground service at London/Heathrow Terminal 5 is smooth and no hassle. Check in and security was very fast and efficient. I particularly like BA's boarding procedure at Heathrow, very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight. Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches legroom compared to CX's 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seats. IFE had a few glitches but the FA's were happy to assist and worked perfectly throughout the flight. However, more movies, TV programmes and music options could be offered. Meals were mediocre. Drinks were served around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was either curry, vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still not as good as CX. Portions could be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options: pasta or chicken casserole, I went for the latter. Again, portions could be better. Overall, I would fly long haul with BA again on their new product (A380, B777-300ER and B787)."
1293,Shaleel Kesavan (United Kingdom) 29th October 2015,7/10,"""very high standard of service""","A superb flight and a very high standard of service. The Dreamliner aircraft was very clean. The seats were perfectly comfortable. The staff were smart and professional at all times. The steward offered to hang my jacket and we were offered drinks and snacks throughout the flight. The quality of the Indian (Tamil) food was second to none and authentic. The captain gave clear and friendly announcements. Overall I felt proud to fly British Airways to India. To me, the airline is a cut above the rest."
1294,Phil Carter (United Kingdom) 29th October 2015,10/10,"""very good flying experience""","LHR to Venice was on time, friendly cheerful crew and a very enjoyable plate of cold cuts, cheeses, warm rolls and fruit for breakfast, way better than any other breakfast I've had on a BA flight long or short haul. Seats comfortable, very enjoyable flight. The return leg, Barcelona to LHR had the same meal so was very happy plus a glass of wine as it was lunchtime. The standby crew member (who happened to be a purser) in business class was chatty, friendly and pleasant to everyone. He did his best to make up for his colleagues major shortcomings! The original designated purser for the flight on the other hand was well .. he plonked the meal down in front of you without uttering one word. The only words he spoke to the entire 24 passengers in the club section were 'do you want it or not'. He put the roll basket in front of everyone's nose but still did not utter one word. It was bizarre - I've never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passengers whatever class they were flying! He couldn't even be polite to his colleague with just a 'pass me some cokes' and that was that. Overall we had a very good flying experience with BA but I wont forget that purser and his attitude for a long time!"
1295,K Riley (United States) 29th October 2015,9/10,"""not helped by customer service""","San Francisco to Edinburgh via London with British Airways. Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we waited over an hour before we were informed, only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made, that our luggage was lost at Heathrow - along with 500 other bags. Things happen, and can be forgiven; it's what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. We were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. We were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. Since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through Scotland, we gave them the address of the B&B where we would be the following night, essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. We received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. They did not arrive. In the next seven days, I spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in India who were absolutely no help at all. The customer service phone line at BA was not being answered, and the supposed courier service phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of service as well. I emailed both the courier service and BA customer service and did not receive a response from either one. Still, the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. On the evening of the fifth day, it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line (in India) who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in Edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. The bags were continually listed as being out for delivery, but they never showed up. We were never contacted, and neither was the B&B where we had had them (supposedly) sent. On the morning of the sixth day, on yet another call to India, I stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that I was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. Then, in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the Edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there, that they had never been out for delivery at all. We would be in Tarbert on Harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. Seven days after our arrival in Edinburgh. During the seven days, we had to purchase clothes to wear. We missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with BA and the time spent shopping for clothes. When we made the return flight, we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. Finally, a month later, we have received a note of intended compensation from British Airways - for the amount of the clothing only. Not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn't have needed to buy or to check through, and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of British Airways. That's completely on them, and we should be reimbursed for the charges. One would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience, but nothing was offered."

Jason Duckling (United Kingdom) 28th October 2015",2/10,"""keep expectations in check""","The 747 is definitely showing it's age. Nonetheless it was comfortable. Pre take off drinks offered included water, OJ or sparkling wine. BA also gives the option of pre-ordering your choice of main course online so although I did notice they ran out of choice towards the end of the service I had received my beef. I advise anyone in First/Business/World Traveller Plus to use this facility. World traveller Plus is definitely an 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines premium economy which is more a 'business minus'. So keep expectations in check. You get a bigger seat, pre take off drink, little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal. However, considering that I paid only £170 per sector on top of the usual World Traveller (economy) fare it was worth every penny in my eye. Would I pay a crazy supplement for this class of travel? No. But if the surcharge is minimal I'd highly recommend it."
1297,K Anderson (United States) 27th October 2015,7/10,"""nothing was offered to help""","My daughter was booked on a flight from Antigua to St. Kitts on September 5, 2015. (flight BA2157) The flight left nearly 10 minutes early stranding 30 passengers who had just managed to get through customs. I have no idea how a flight can leave early or how you can leave without 30 passengers. The attendant at the desk merely informed these passengers that the desk was closed and they should return tomorrow. It was 3.00 on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing was offered to help these passengers get to their final destination. After calling multiple times and sending various emails, I was ""granted"" a refund. My full refund offer came with a $50 cancellation fee and a $40 service fee. I have yet to accept the offer. We never cancelled her flight nor received anything that looks like service. Do not fly this airline. They are inept and have no idea what customer service is. There is no 'value for money' when the flight departs early."
1298,Peter Dimblad (United Kingdom) 27th October 2015,1/10,"""lot of money for little in return""","My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade."
1299,Arthur Savage (United Kingdom) 26th October 2015,2/10,"""complain about the way we were treated ""","My wife and I who are 76 and 77 respectively arrived at terminal 5 in Jan 2015 to travel to Johannesburg.This was our first experience of the size of this terminal and assumed that this was where we were to eventualy board our flight. However after sitting around for many hours it occured to us that we had picked up any information regarding the flight,so we went to the BA desk only to be informed that the flight had left,and that we had been waiting in the wrong part of terminal five, and if we had been in the right area we would have heard them paging us. Whilst I take full resposibilty not checking the flight boards properly I would like to complain about the way we were treated from that point on, it was now 11 pm on a cold Jan night, my wife and I were escorted to the exit and left to find shelter for the night in an area that we were totally lost in, until we returned for a different flight the next day."
1300,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 21st October 2015,5/10,"""British Airways really don't care ""","There are so many poor reviews here for British Airways, and I am just about to add another one. The return trip started in the shared lounge at Pisa. Its comfortable enough - but forget it if you are hungry. There is no food to snack on - just a few bags of crisps, nuts and sealed croissants. Booze choice is okay. Quite why, in Italy of all places, a platter of mixed meats, cheeses and typical antipasti cannot be provided - probably costing about £50 a day, is a mystery. British Airways don't care. No airbridge so a trudge to the plane. It was an ex BMI A319 and given they ceased trading three years ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show British Airways branding and not BMI; very strange. Old BA Club Europe. Tired seats. FAs were fine. Food mediocre. Funny thing was the cabin smelt of a rather tasty ""meaty"" sort of meal. As we took off I was starving and full of optimism. All we got was a miserable afternoon tea; dried sandwiches, scones and jam. I compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonics. I asked myself, is this ""worth it"" - the extra for the product. What you get I suppose is a toilet for 12/14 passengers, compared with two toilets between 120 or so.  Wider seats (no extra legroom).  A meal over economy but not by much,  glasses to drink from rather than plastic beakers and a faster exit from the plane,  a few extra AVIOS points - that's it basically! Not a lot. Anyway we left 10 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Nice smooth flight but I could have had that on Ryanair. British Airways really don't care as the many reviews on here clearly show."
1301,Steven Murphy (Australia) 21st October 2015,4/10,"""how underwhelmed we were""","London to Sydney via Singapore in business class. I am English born and have always had an affinity with British Airways. I had not flown with them for a while and booked business class seats for my wife and I, and have to say how underwhelmed we were with the whole experience and will not be trying them again. They are so far behind other airlines - you expect in business class to feel just a bit special, but as reviewed earlier you do not get any special service. A lousy check in, herded along with the rest on boarding, a lousy inflight toiletry bag. As for the food, just awful on both legs to Sydney. The crew on the London to Singapore were unengaging, at least the 2nd leg crew were better. The bad news is that I still have the return leg to LHR with them."
1302,S Khans (United Kingdom) 21st October 2015,4/10,"""my seat was broken""","British Airways from Antigua to Gatwick. A shabby aircraft, my seat was broken, it would recline without command, the head rest was broken and the seat covers were very worn. The inflight entertainment had to be re set as it wasn't working and when it did work my screen did not display the safety briefing, images would freeze, in effect I did not receive the briefing. The cabin staff refused to dispose of my wife's drink because it was not finished, I had to request another hostess to take it. The food was poor quality in general too, looked like a kids meals, pasta with cheese. Check in was good, queues were long but the staff were very helpful and the flight left on time. British Airways is not in the league of other long haul carriers like Emirates, a lot of work to be done to refresh it's image."

Loke Foo (Singapore) 19th October 2015",8/10,"""lot of catching up to do""","London Heathrow to Singapore, and the business class of British Airways is below the standard set by its competitors. At Heathrow terminal 5, there is no special check in counter for business class passenger. After performing the self check in, we have to join a common queue to drop our check-in bag. I spent 30 mins in the queue. The business class seat is narrower than other airlines. There is also a lack of storage space for small items such as glasses. It is relatively comfortable to sit and sleep on, but business class travel is about a total experience and British Airways has a lot of catching up to do."
1305,I  Iliopoulos  (United Kingdom) 18th October 2015,3/10,"""minimized the leg space""","In the last couple of years, British Airways has been refurbishing aircrafts nad has minimized the leg space to ridiculous levels. This, not only for economy, but also in Business class. It is unfair to ask a Business class passenger to sit so uncomfortably when they pay double the price of economy. In addition, they have this policy for 2 bags, but one going under the seat in front of the passenger - this applies even to Business Class!"
1306,D Orchard (United Kingdom) 18th October 2015,2/10,"""cabin crew efficient""","San Diego to Heathrow. Check-in, security and boarding were all with minimum delay. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. Food quality wasn't great, nothing like food served a few years ago and their amenity bag really isn't worth having. Having said that, we had a pleasant flight as crew made up for disappointing food. We even managed several hours sleep which is always a bonus."
1307,Sarah Howell (United Kingdom) 17th October 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"Having originally booked in to fly Economy it was a nice surprise to see we had been upgraded to Premium Economy. The seats were large and reclined quite a lot. The food was delicious. Entertainment was the same and offered a good standard of films and tv series. However, having seen the little difference between economy and premium economy, we don't think we would be prepared to pay the difference."
1308,ian depper (United Kingdom) 17th October 2015,7/10,"""food was indifferent""","We flew British Airways World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) on the flight from Vancouver to London. The male steward responsible for our section of the aircraft was indifferent to passengers, during the night section of the flight, he spilt a drink over my wife, made no attempt to clean up the resulting spill, and when he returned to our area he casually commented, ""Did I spill something on you"", my wife replied, ""Yes you did and I hope it was water"", ""No"", he replied, "" It was juice"" and walked away. The inflight entertainment was limited and subject to repeatedly breaking down, the food was indifferent and the snack we received before landing at Heathrow consisted of a dry croissant, no butter some jam and a half a cup of tea. I have not travelled with British Airways for a number of years due to previous bad experiences where the passenger is made to feel like an inconvenience, I hoped they would have learnt and improved, this certainly was not the case on this flight."
1309,Owen Evans (United Kingdom) 16th October 2015,5/10,"""leg room was good""","Booked through Iberia a year before departure with the addition of a connection to Las Palmas, online check in completed 24 hours in advance which is when I noticed that yet again BA had subbed the Boeing 767 on this service to an A320. The leg room in this 0730 departure from LHR was good with the new seating offering a more comfortable ride than Iberia Express. Food was a cold breakfast croissant which wasn't too bad once it had come up to cabin temperature. Cabin crew weren't the friendliest bunch. If you have a connection at Madrid Barajas Airport leave at least two hours - the place is huge with very confusing signposts and for some reason if you connect T4S to a T4 departure you have to go through Security, but if you do a T4 to T4S connection there's no additional security."
1310,Andrew Kirkpatrick (United Kingdom) 14th October 2015,5/10,"""great choice of films""","Originally booked with Easyjet, Manchester to Moscow and they cancelled my return flight without offering re-routing. Then re-booked with Brussels Airline and they had problems at Brussels with runway repairs but to their credit rebooked me with BA. Finally got my flight sorted with British Airways, comfortable, good food, great choice of films. They lost half a point because I went to the BA information desk at Moscow Airport and asked 'Do you speak English?' to a lady in BA uniform confidently expecting the answer ""of course"". I got a shake of the head and a finger pointed towards a colleague already engaged with another customer."
1311,Y Shachar (Israel) 12th October 2015,9/10,"""disgraceful attitude""","Don't fly with British Airways, unless you don't have baggage or don't care about it. We took a connection flight via London LHR to San Diego and all our baggage (and of many other passengers in this flight), was delayed for two days. Other flyers told us this problem is frequent with BA. When our baggage finally arrived, one of the suitcases was damaged beyond repair. We filed a complaint, but so far (more than a month) heard nothing from them albeit several calls. Disgraceful attitude. As a final accord, on the return flight, we could not check online, for some unclear reason, while other passengers could. So my wife and I got separate middle seats. Nice."

Craig Cutts (United Kingdom) 12th October 2015",3/10,"""decent service for a short flight""","LHR-AMS-LHR checked in online which is quick and simple bag drop at T5 very quick, was able to use the lounge through my FFS which I like. Boarding on to a full flight quick and seats on an exit row comfy with lots of room for 1hr flight, aircraft clean and tidy a drink served, arrived on time and bags off pretty quick. Checked in on line for the return bag drop quick as was security, the gate D28 is a long walk from security. Used the BA lounge which while small is nice although not many food option.. Boarding for A321 took a while but departed on time and once on board the aircraft appeared new. Crew served a drink on the 50 minute flight arrived on time bags out quickly. All in all a decent service for a short flight."
1313,D Taylor (United Kingdom) 12th October 2015,7/10,"""a disgrace and inedible""","British Airways from London to Bahrain and return. Both flights on a very old Boeing 777, apparently there are only a few of these left. Advantage is that the seats are still 3-3-3 and not 3-4-3. Both flights on time. Outbound flight very full, cabin crew worked hard but without much enthusiasm. Meal was very poor, the so-called dinner was chicken in a slimy gravy. There was no sign of either fresh fruit or vegetables. Later a cardboard box was issued containing a chicken sandwich. Return flight food was even worse, but as departure was 1.30 am the initial effort, called a ""snack"", was again in a cardboard box, and contained nuts, dry biscuits and a couple of minibars of chocolate. Later in the flight ""breakfast"" was served. The choice was mixed grill with chicken or omelette. The mixed grill turned out to be an amorphous yellow mass-presumably pretending to be egg, with a round coin shaped structure which was so-called chicken and four potato discs. It was a disgrace and inedible. British Airways has to do something about its catering, it compares very poorly with other airlines. If the food is not worth eating then they should not serve it."
1314,Paul Karagounis (Spain) 11th October 2015,4/10,"""service was good""","The first class lounge at Heathrow was reasonably quiet. Great choice of beverages and champagne and selection of food. Plenty of sitting options, light, magazines and newspapers. Very impressed with champagne and the gin bars. After years of traveling with British Airways still I have not managed to secure a treatment in the Elemis spa even when I travel first (staff at the elemis reception rather rude). Boarding on time and by priority. Window seat in the last row of the club world cabin on the upper deck of A380 with aisle access. Staff polite. The service was good. Good selection of food and beverages and wines. Wide range of entertainment. Seat comfortable and private by using the divider. The amenity kit adequate. Arrival was on time."
1315,T Long (United Kingdom) 11th October 2015,9/10,"""cabin the biggest disappointment""","This was the first time we had traveled long haul with British Airways. The ground staff at terminal 5 were helpful and friendly. The aircraft cabin was the biggest disappointment, it hadn't been updated since the plane entered service. The inflight entertainment screen was tiny and unclear, film selection was good. The food was okay and flight was on-time. If British airways are running a new plane on your route, its likely okay, but if it is one of their Boeing 777's (old planes), I would consider other airlines."
1316,A Puhakka (Finland) 10th October 2015,6/10,"""failed to provide information""","Our British Airways flight from Helsinki to London had issues with it's brakes so the departure was delaytd. Original departure time was at 17.15, there were next info at 18.30, 19.00, 19.30 and 20.45. The captain gave us an announcement of situation at the gate around at 19.00. Meal vouchers were give at 20.00 for those who were still at the gate. Then after 21.00 an announcement to get luggage and hotel vouchers from the arrival hall. Next information will be given next morning at 09.00, which later was postponed until 14.30. Requests of rebookings were refused as the flight were not cancelled. They just said come to the airport early enough. British Airways failed to provide information about EU passanger's rights as it had to be requested separately. Lot of fellow passsengers were not aware of their rights. Next afternoon local grond handling company only had regular number of check-in desks open even there were two flights cheking-in at the same time. So only three desks open and they were not able to start checking us in but requesting us to step aside for the same day flight passengers. Great as we had only been waiting around 22hrs for our flights. Finally our flight got new departure time which was at 17.30, later to changed 18.00. At the gate departure time came and went and no announcement were made. Departure time were postponed until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new delay. When requesting some futher information it was said it's the same reason as yesterday but we had been given a written statement saying this aircraft had been fixed. At 18.30 still no announcement and passengers get anxious about mimimal information given by aviator. Then 20 min later British Airways cancels this flight. Now rebookings promised by next morning or then have to contact British Airways directly. Another hotel night at the airport hotel and we already knew how the procedure goes. Next day rebooked for Finnair flight to London and arriving London 45 hrs late and reaching the final destination about 46hrs late. The only positive aspect was cockpit and cabin crew effort to provide some information at the gate area at the beginning of whole ordeal."
1317,B Degener (Netherlands) 10th October 2015,1/10,"""a pleasant flight""","British Airways 3-class Boeing 777-200 is used on this flight to Bangkok. I was seated in 26D which is a bulkhead seat on the aisle, behind the Premium Economy cabin. I like the fact that BA still have 3-3-3 seat layout on the B777 in economy while many airlines are using 3x4x3 lay out. I had plenty of legroom and on this particular flight I had the best sleep. Meals were average, certainly not bad. Cabin crew kind and professional. All in all a pleasant flight."
1318,A Sommerville (United Kingdom) 9th October 2015,7/10,"""plane was really scruffy""","Flew British Airways from Glasgow to Bangkok via Heathrow. GLA to LHR flight great, clean plane, staff friendly. Business lounge in Glasgow was most enjoyable. Heathrow to Bangkok in premium economy (economy class looked very cramped), the plane was really scruffy and my foot rest stuck. British Airways have let the standard slip on the smartness of the cabin interior - the curtain from Businees to Premium Econemy was all ripped, very scruffy bad impression. Excellent staff, food also good. Flights on time. But British Airways Premium Economy is not a patch on EVA Air. BA need to upgrade planes on this route or lose customers to the other carriers. Even the staff uniforms looked washed out."

John Rolfe (United Kingdom) 9th October 2015",6/10,"""legroom could be better""","Flew British Airways from Fuerteventura to Gatwick in a refurbished A320, with the new style seats, having flown out earlier on a A319 with the old seating. Nothing much to choose between the two, but slightly preferred the older style. Not sure why they have the central seat converted to tray space and would prefer a wider seat and smaller tray space! Legroom could also be better. Both flights were comfortable and landed ahead of schedule. No lounge available at Fuerteventura which is a shame. Inflight service excellent, food for short-haul was good.  If only BA could have given us a couple of inches of extra legroom."
1320,G Leach (United Kingdom) 6th October 2015,5/10,"""brusque drinks service""","British Airways from Heathrow to Manchester - ok it's only a 35 min flight but about a one hour delay with no explanation before take off and no apology from the flight deck. I booked a seat near the front and was moved to the very back row 'because of a change of aircraft'. There I could hear every word of conversation from the young cabin crew in the galley. And not all things the passengers should be hearing. Torn uniform on female attendant, brusque drinks service from male steward who gave the impression that the job is a bit beneath him. Waiting ages for the plane to empty so I could get off. Crew not helping anyone and no eye contact for the dismal goodbye on getting off."
1321,Marion Bailey (United Kingdom) 5th October 2015,3/10,"""our luggage left at Heathrow""","First and last time travelling with British Airways. The flight outw was reasonable, although they are sadly lacking in comparison to other airlines. My first question is does anybody from British Airways actually read these comments? If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in Toronto on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other bags. They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem - after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up on the Hotel Manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4 - not a problem normally. but it had cost £90.00 extra to book these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude."
1322,T Lambord (United Kingdom) 5th October 2015,3/10,"""Boeing 747 horribly outdated""","London Heathrow to San Francisco with British Airways and unimpressed. Checked in online but had a bag to drop: I was issued with a fresh boarding pass at the airport, and was there plenty early enough. Everything seemed normal until I reached the gate for boarding - the scanner at the final checkpoint reported ""not checked in"". After a 5 minute or so wait, I was allowed to board, but moved to a different seat (I was told this was the final one, but not given any explanation as to why). Once on the plane, I was asked to move to what turned out to be my original seat. I filled in BAs feedback form about this and asked what was going on, but they were apparently receiving a high volume of complaints and never responded. In the circumstances, I think I'll stick with more reliable airlines from now on. The flight itself was delayed by a 1/2 hour while they waited for ""more passengers"". The flight itself was uneventful, and the meals and service okay for economy. Having said that, the Boeing 747 is horribly outdated, and the IFE system repeatedly failed and had to be rebooted."
1323,A Boyd (United Kingdom) 4th October 2015,2/10,"""very disappointed in British Airways""","I'm not one for publishing reviews but following discussions of flight problems, have just heard of Skytrax. I have lost track of the numbers of flights I've taken over the years, on business in Europe and on holiday worldwide. With family in the US, regular flights have almost exclusively till now been with British Airways: some economy, some WTP, more recently in Business. Service, value etc has to now ranged from acceptable to good, occasionally excellent. Shame things seem to have changed. For our annual trip last December I booked my 7-year old daughter and myself on British Airways LHR to Chicago, returning from Washington Dulles to LHR. Both flights in Business Class. Booking process online reasonably good, with helpful assistance from a ""real person"" when there was a problem - which happened 3 times in the months before departure. No common sense used when flights are cancelled and ""suitable alternatives"" booked, when seats had been pre-purchased, when clearly travelling with a child. Check-in and departure were smooth. Travel in economy means that they feed children first. Travel in business and they serve children serve after the adults.  The ""child meal"" (when it eventually arrived) was a disgrace, I wouldn't feed it to an animal! Peas blackened, mash dried and crusty. Not surprisingly she didn't want it. Ended up eating my meal. Entertainment screen (essential for children and part of the treat of the journey) didn't work, so we swopped seats - so no entertainment screen for Mummy! Thank goodness I had my Kindle. No apologies from staff. More interested in the male business travellers. Return flight after Christmas from  Washington Dulles to LHR was slightly better. Evening meal available in lounge prior to boarding - providing you're an adult. Again nothing for children except some biscuits. If I'm willing to pay British Airways Business Class fares for myself and my daughter, I expect better service than this. Very disappointed. Will I fly BA again? Yes, but grudgingly and once the airmiles are used up who knows?"
1324,Jonathan Green (United Kingdom) 3rd October 2015,4/10,"""disgraceful level of cleanliness""","Nairobi to London with British Airways. The service was good, except that they gave given up on collecting jackets. Seat is getting tired - bits coming off. Disgraceful level of cleanliness - between the seat and the side of the cabin was a very old accumulation of fluff, mouldy peanuts, crumbs, an old sandwich wrapper and a mini mars bar (very old). Felt sick. Given this was highlighted in the press recently - it must be that British Airways really does not care."
1325,Peter Driscoll (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2015,5/10,"""staff were great""","Outward on the 06.30 flight 7th September - good all the way. Snack was fine, coffee nice. Staff were great. Checked in on ine but long queue for bag drop - BA need to improve this. Security again a long queue but that is reflective of the troubled times we live in I fear. Return on 16.35 flight 22nd September - everything fine except seat 11b in permanent recline (didn't realise it until I got told about it prior to landing so apologised to lady behind me). Sandwich and Red wine were nice. Considering I booked early and got a great price, I have no complaints. Flight deck information good both ways."
1326,W Sardar (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2015,9/10,"""seats are far too cramped""","I recently travelled British Airways from Phoenix to London Heathrow. This is my 3rd time I have flown this route onboard one of the Boeing 747-400 and I must say British Airways have got to either fully upgrade their B747 fleet or retire the aircraft. The seats are far too cramped and not comfortable, the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several times as they stopped working or didn't work at all, the heat in the cabin was unbearable at times and very uncomfortable. The only plus points were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasn't too bad. I am aware that around 18 Boeing 747's are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the B747 on the Phoenix route is not, and for me as the route I travel, causes me concern and has me wondering if I will travel with BA again.  Not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesn't mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move, seats that don't feel like they are going to cripple you, have an entertainment system that works and has a better selection of movies/tv shows/music. Other airlines such as Emirates have a fabulous system even in economy so why can't British Airways use the same type of technology. If BA want to compete, please do something about it."
1327,Rhys Crompton (United Kingdom) 2nd October 2015,3/10,"""crew were friendly and attentive""","Check-in for my British Airways flight at Gatwics North Terminal with no queue and staff friendly and chatty. Boarding was quick. The A319 had not yet been fitted with the new seats, but they were still comfortable and moderately spacious. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The return journey was also quite good, except the flight was change to a 01:10 departure instead of 23:40 so it meant that nearly most shops (except duty free) at Alicante were closed. Also it meant that the flight arrived back into Gatwick at 02:40 which wasn't very pleasant as we had to then drive another hour and a half home. British Airways Gatwick operation is quite good and punctual not like Heathrow."
1328,P Hilliard (Ireland) 1st October 2015,8/10,"""clapped-out aircraft""","These British Airways flights were undoubtedly the worst we've ever had to South Africa in ten years of travelling there. The seats were narrow, lumpy and incredibly uncomfortable especially for a long haul journey. I thought initially that we were unlucky and got broken or faulty seats on our outward journey, but they were just as bad on the return journey. To add insult to injury, we'd selected and paid for seats of our preference, but when we got to the airport for our return journey we were told the seats were gone, and simply told we would have to apply for a refund. The worst aspect of the flight however, was the heat. The aircraft was oppressively hot and stuffy for hours on the way from Johannesburg to London. Many passengers complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning system appeared too old to regulate the temperature. Also the entertainment system had to be switched off and rebooted several times because many passengers' consoles were not working. There were passengers who had to do without entertainment for the entire 10 hour flight. These aircraft are not fit for flying and should have been retired a decade ago. Pity the poor crew who have to work on these clapped-out aircraft every day. We've been travelling to South Africa several times a year for the past decade and this was our first time travelling with British Airways. Clearly it will also be our last. Avoid British Airways or their Boeing 747-400s at all costs."

R Simon (Austria) 1st October 2015",1/10,"""pretty much a low-cost airline""","Vienna to London Heathrow return in September 2015, both flights in Economy on an A320. Crew pleasant but not doing more than absolutely required. A snack and drinks were served on both legs. This time the sandwich consisted of a mini pastrami and cheese sandwich and a mini black currant bun. Edible, but not BA´s best sandwich offering.  Additional drinks were served on request. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. While the seat are slightly better than the Recaro slim seats, I miss the older more comfortable seats with better leg room. I did not really realize that BA has changed the rules recently and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). Also, if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR75 at the airport or EUR35 on line.  The final fare with BA can be substantially higher than the initial price quote - the additional charges are displayed during the booking process and if one commits to checking luggage during the booking process, the charges are lower. With the exception of a free drink and sandwich, British Airways Economy product is now pretty much a low-cost airline product. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checking luggage. While VIE-LHR was on time, the return LHR-VIE leg was delayed for one hour. After a timely boarding the full plane was waiting for the departure, but then the flight deck announced that they are waiting for some cargo to be loaded and they missed their assigned slot, which meant waiting an hour for a new slot. So, basically BA inconvenienced a whole plane of passengers to load some delayed cargo. Flying with hand baggage only, I used web check-in for both flights which worked fine. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE. The Lounge as such is acceptable (small and mostly packed), but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. The selection seems to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE. BA Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 a comfortable oasis amid a busy airport and food and drinks selection was better than VIE. Wine selection was nice. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE, which I consider a huge benefit over using T5, which tends to be a mess for passengers. While I stopped flying British Airways Business in Europe they BA changed Business seating to Economy seats with no additional legroom, I see no valid reason to pay any surcharge for this product, but I still consider BA one of the better options for Economy flights in Europe. However their new low-cost airline concept also means that the times when I was willing to pay higher prices just for flying with BA over easyJet or Austrian on this route are unfortunately over."

Ryan Shaw (Australia) 27th September 2015",5/10,British Airways customer review,"I had not flown British Airways business class for years. Sydney to Singapore was a reward flight and I probably wouldn't pay as much as other airlines for this product, but if it was cheaper than competitors I would pick it. Seats a bit narrow but otherwise acceptable and I like the fact you can slide the table away and get out easily. Service was top notch and very surprised, had an excellent stewardess in our area. Meal service with two salads and some nice bread along with a decent main. Small snack before landing - I always feel that a bigger option should be provided on a 7 hour flight, since it is too small for you not to have to eat again when you arrive. IFE had a good selection and worked fine. I like the way they have set out the Club World cabin - it is a bit different and although crowded it is calm and professional. Obviously the seats do not compare to the best out there. If they were materially cheaper than say Singapore Airlines or Emirates then I would take it. If they want to charge a similar price then obviously the product is not the same quality."
1331,B Weaver (United Kingdom) 27th September 2015,7/10,"""lose some of their arrogant approach""","Tokyo Haneda to Heathrow in Club World with British Airways.  My trip was on an old Boeing 777, and apart from the old product, I could not believe the dirt and wear in this cabin. Crumbs and mess around the bottom and edges of the seat, grubby marks that I presume even the Japanese cleaners could not remove. The toilet I used remained dirty throughout the flight. The meal service has been much debated, and is served (rather pushed at you) on a cheap economy style format, and quality is on a par with JAL economy class I used in August. I'm British and like to support BA, but the honest fact is that BA have slipped right down against from the competition. My journey out was from Frankfurt on Lufthansa, an airline I probably wouldn't have used a few years ago, but their business class standards are so much higher. BA cabin staff should go to Lufthansa for some training, and maybe they could lose some of their arrogant approach."

Rowan Michaels (Canada) 27th September 2015",3/10,"""product and service is so old and tired""","A 3 hour delay but notified by text earlier in the day so no waiting around. The problem is that British Airways Business Class Club World product and service is so old and tired that it is just very poor value and quality. The inflight entertainment is constantly faulty and breaking - they had to keep resetting it (this has happened on the last two BA Club flights I have been on), the seats are tired, it was not very clean - the lockers by the windows on the upper deck were dirty and falling apart. The food was quite good except the dessert was awful - they always seem to serve the same lemon dessert on this leg. The crew were pleasant, but the planes are too old and tired now to make this an attractive option. I look to avoid British Airways when I can for Business Class."
1333,Michael Shoesmith (United Kingdom) 26th September 2015,3/10,"""for just £39 was a bargain""","Barcelona to London Heathrow and late again! British Airways really need to sort out their schedules. I can always guarantee a late out of foreign terminal, but early or on-time when flying outbound. Lateness is normally due to baggage or missing person or someone who has not turned up to travel. The food service is still complimentary thank goodness. You get a twin pack of a roll and currant bun on the Barcelona route - better than a huge panini they used to serve. Drinks service is extremely limited as always, one serving only of Tea/Coffee. For the price, using a schedule service into London Heathrow and complimentary light snack for just £39 was a bargain!"

They spent ten days on their wedding-moon. When it was time to return they were unable to check in online. The website offered a phone number to call and there was no answer. They tried for three hours. They finally called me in the UK and I called British Airways. I was told that because I did not buy the tickets with my credit card, they couldn't help me. I was given another number to call. The second person I spoke to managed to resolve the problem that was preventing online check in, which meant that it was then possible. However, so much time had passed sorting this mess out that by the time we got into the system most of the seats were allocated and my son and his new bride could not sit next to one another for this long haul flight. When they tried to upgrade they were told it would be $1000US each. British Airways could not care less."
1335,C Garzich (United States) 26th September 2015,1/10,"""British Airways a cut above US carriers""","Maybe I've just flown US carriers too much, but I think British Airways is a cut above them, as it has been in the last few years. They take care of you during the flight. Multiple drink services with alcoholic beverages included, and water and orange juice through the flight. Hot meal service to begin with a better than average beef offering, and then a sandwich, tea, etc before landing. I am part of their frequent flyer program and was given a different seat from the one I had selected - the seat just behind the bulkhead. Ordinarily I don't like those seats as there's nowhere to put your things when the plane takes off, but I was in the middle and the three seats between me and the man in the other aisle seat in my row were empty (presumably this is why I was moved to this seat, as it was ""better""), so I just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine. Seat was wider than US economy, with more leg room, and a leg rest that came out from below, so quite comfortable. I can't ever say I enjoy a 7+ hour flight, but flying with British Airways makes it more bearable."
1336,Y Cole (United Kingdom) 25th September 2015,10/10,"""not recommend flying long haul with BA""","Having previously flown with British Airways a few years ago I was quite disappointed. The legroom was as expected and I had no complaints about that, but the food was awful and the service was terrible. We were sat next to a group of drunken passengers who were loud and were continued to be served drinks throughout. I am sure this didn't make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised - running out of drinks etc. As we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choices by the time we were offered food - the crew were not really interested. When asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to us and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused. The food was poor quality, dry hard chicken with very little flavour. Breakfast was an egg mayonnaise roll and again there was no alternative. I paid extra to fly with British Airways but found the service and food lacking - really would not recommend flying long haul with them if you can help it. You can see they have made cuts to the budget!"
1337,B Jones (United Kingdom) 24th September 2015,4/10,"""wouldn't recommend spending extra for Club Europe""","London Heathrow to Bologna return in British Airways Club Europe. Very disappointing. The seats are basically the same as economy seats, they just don't sit someone in the middle seat, so no meaningful increase in legroom or width. Food was very average on the way out (salad with very dry prawns, pretty tasteless) but nice on the way back (tagliatelle). Staff were on the whole were good, but given the seats I wouldn't recommend spending the extra money for Club Europe."
1338,M Bailey (United Kingdom) 24th September 2015,5/10,"""my wife and I were seated 4 rows apart""","Checked in online for our British Airways flight from Larnaca to Heathrow. and discovered my wife and I were seated 4 rows apart. No seats together were available in the seating chart under ""manage my booking"". Is the BA software so poor that it can't keep 2 seats together when booked at the same time? The answer must be yes. The check-in person said they would try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate, but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay. In this case needless to say our separate seating remained separate. I wouldn't take the trouble to record this here except that I have felt irritated for the last few flights I've done with British Airways, with poor food, in-flight entertainment screens that work intermittently, faulty headphones, or being seated so that the only screen available is the other side of the business class dividing curtain which was drawn half way through the film. I've preferred British Airways on the basis that some of the budget operators charge you the same by the time you add their various extra charges. I'm now coming to the conclusion that if they charge the same I might as well fly with them and then I won't have to wait an extra 5 mins to get off the plane while the business class punters get off first."

Daniel Chambers (Netherlands) 23rd September 2015",2/10,"""flight experience was great""","After a small delay in AMS, we departed for short hop to LHR. Boarding went quickly, we were assigned emergency exit seats which were very comfortable. At cruising altitude, we got breakfast snack. The crew was friendly, except the one assigned to our section who wasn't very talkative and a bit snobby. Overall flight experience was great and service is the way we like to see it.

1341,Mark Williams (United Kingdom) 18th September 2015,9/10,"""I will still avoid British Airways if I can""","LHR-PHX 16 Sept. Last few times I've flown British Airways, I'd been forced to consider BA as a discount airline that doesn't deserve its 4 star rating, and I was not looking forward to this flight. We had awful seats at the back of a very full plane so asked at bag drop about upgrades. Paid £230 each to go up to WTP (a bargain when added to the price we paid for our seats in coach) and it was worth it! Does anyone know why we check in online or go to a self-serve kiost but still have to go to bag drop to pretty much go through the check in process again? Boarding went as usual, smiley welcome aboard and to our seats. This aircraft had WTP immediately behind First. Good leg room, comfortable seat, small cabin of its own. A small amenity pack is provided, although most of the stuff in it is inferior and hardly worth having. Only one FA worked our cabin but he was friendly and efficient and the lack of more staff was not noticable. Drinks trolley and lunch menus then food served. Lunch with 2 options, china plates, real cutlery, napkins etc.  Food was very good, even though only one option left by time we were served. Had beef, which was tasty and tender and well presented. A snack box was passed out a few hours later and dinner served 2 hours before landing. Interestingly, dinner was from economy. Foil dish, plastic cutlery, paper napkins. Given the price of WTP ticket, would have expected better then that.  Only one juice/water round but FAs were in the galley and happy to get whatever you wanted (until we drank tham out of bubbles!). Being an older plane, the IFE was ancient with a very small screen that had grid lines showing and a barely adequate movie selection. Noise cancelling headset was not the best and hurt my ears. IFE was only a minor irritation, as flight was scheduled 10 hours 45 and I was more interested in comfort, which WTP provided. Only real gripe is the tray table. It folds out of the seat arm as a drinks tray, then unfolds to a full tray. Problem is, drinks slide off when in small mode and you have to brace the full tray on your knees to stop your dinner sliding off. British Airways is relying on its past reputation rather than providing a good product these days and I avoid them if I can because of that. I didn't think I would be saying this but I enjoyed this flight and it was probably the best BA flight I've had. A shame then that I will still avoid British Airways if I can."
1342,Tony Handley (United Kingdom) 18th September 2015,8/10,"""greedy company who are in decline""","I have not got as far as even flying with British Airways this time around, and the customer service are a nightmare. Sent an email with flight confirmation and agreed time to us, yet a later email tells us different time. They say we need to take it up with Vueling, their sister company - call Vueling and are told it is a British Airways issue. None of them will take responsibility for changing our flight times without asking. It's now too late to get an alternative flight at a reasonable price, so have to return at a stupid time in the morning which has ruined our anniversary weekend break. No compensation or anything. Horrible, greedy company who thankfully are in decline. Pay a bit more and fly with genuine 4 or 5 star airlines. About 3 levels below Cathay Pacific and the rest around that price bracket."
1343,Vikramaditya Singh (United Kingdom) 18th September 2015,1/10,"""British Airways has fallen prey to greed""","British Airways introduced its new Club Europe business class which is basically economy class, minus the middle seat. Leg room is same as in economy. When I asked flight crew what's new about it, she indicated with her hands that the seats were more cramped now. It is a shame that British Airways has fallen prey to greed and instead of upgrading its business product, it has introduced a very poor product on Club Europe. Food was poor and so was the inflight service. If the person in front reclines, it is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it. I will never fly British Airways Club Europe again."
1344,Tom Lewis (United Kingdom) 17th September 2015,2/10,"""British Airways have gradually deteriorated""","British Airways from Heathrow to Vancouver outbound, Toronto-Heathrow inbound, both on rather ancient Boeing 747-400. Both flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule and the fare was competitive. Check-in and bag delivery was fine at all 3 airports. The aircraft interiors were shabby at best, seats uncomfortable, IFE hopeless, food awful. Cabin crew were mixed, one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duties in a perfunctory way. One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly. From the good days of quality service in the 1980's, British Airways have gradually deteriorated into a third-class carrier and can never hope to compete on customer service with the airlines from the Middle and Far East. What a shame."
1345,Ian Smith (United Kingdom) 16th September 2015,3/10,"""Boeing 747-400 well past a major refurbishment""","Glasgow to Cape Town via Heathrow with British Airways, and the short flight from Glasgow to Heathrow was fine, exit row seats with plenty of room, although the catering was a bit bizarre, a drink and a packet of crisps. The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote ""her guests"" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers. The old British Airways corporate slogan ""The Worlds Favourite Airline"" are long gone. For our next flight to South Africa or elsewhere, I think it will be back to KLM for us."
1346,Greg Pile (United Arab Emirates) 15th September 2015,4/10,"will never fly British Airways again ""","I have flown business class long haul on Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, American, Singapore, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific and most recently British Airways for work within the last 24 months. I fly long haul 8-10 times a year so I would consider myself to be a moderate user of the service and know what I should expect for the money. I will never fly British Airways again if I can avoid it. I arrived on time and it felt like a safe journey, but everything from check in, to the seat configuration and comfort (and cleanliness), the food and the entertainment system were so far away from the competition. The cabin crew were snooty on the A380 out of LHR - in this example I was a silent observer to several unacceptable customer service responses. The only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the staff at the Washington Dulles lounge, the rest of BA could learn a lot in there. Very disappointing BA, its a shame your product quality is so below par. I'm proud to be British, but not when it comes to our national carrier, what a shame."

Lost luggage office at Amsterdam was difficult to find, but staff were helpful. Form given with email contact address to keep you informed was  totally useless - 4 days of issuing emails each day no response. Phone number called by Viking concierge for 10 hours on and off for 4 days was totally ignored or information totally useless. Finally after obtaining a senior executive email address they found and sent after discussion to my house but not on the day agreed. Taken 26 days to respond to first letter of complaint. 14 days to date and still no reply to second email of complaint. British Airways customer service is laughable."

Steve Scarman (Spain) 8th September 2015",5/10,"""never fly British Airways First class again""","The Concorde Lounge is a long way in the terminal, and after queuing, placed on the bus to the aircraft along with all the other passengers - and wait standing in the crushed bus on the tarmac for 20 minutes. Once onboard, I asked for a Vodka Martini, (not too difficult surely). After a 20 minute wait, the steward informed me he was sorry for the delay, but he had no Martini glasses. Okay, this was British Airways First class, but not such a huge deal, he offered it to me in a Wine glass instead not a big problem.  20 minutes later he returned and said he couldn't serve me a Vodla Martini as there was no Martini on the plane.  Then came the 'Dine as you please' meal option. I asked for my dinner to be served 2 hours into the flight, I was asked my choice and chose the Steak - to be told there was no Steak left.  It was 'suggested' I try the fish, I do not like fish, so I was left with Vegetarian option. The dinner arrived half an hour later, not the two hours later as I requested.  I would never choose to fly British Airways First class again."
1351,Maddalena Bitonte (Italy) 8th September 2015,1/10,"""space for improvement at British Airways""","My British Airways return trip from Milan to Vancouver via back wasn't too bad, but the seats were really unconfortable and there wasn't enough leg room. Furthermore the flights took off late, so i ended up having little time to take the connections. There is definitely space for improvement at British Airways."
1352,Evilasio Silva (United Kingdom) 8th September 2015,4/10,"""British Airways is simply terrible""","I have flown regularly with British Airways between the UK and other European countries, where economy class seats are leather and reasonable onboard service. Based on previous experience, I decided to make an intercontinental flight between the UK and Rio de Janeiro Brazil believing that I would find at least the same comfort offered on European routes by British Airways. It was not. Instead of decent seat conditions expected for a 11 hours duration flight, I found seats that barely accommodate a normal person (not so tall, not overweight) and completely unable to have a decent meal during the flight. The economy class of British Airways can be defined as simply terrible. Do not waste your money by paying a bit more believing you will find comfort in an intercontinental flight flying economy class with British Airways. Just buy the cheapest promotional airline ticket that you find on market, you'll be served the same way and will save some money."
1353,Andrew Hickling (United Kingdom) 7th September 2015,1/10,"""seats comfortable for a short flight""","London Heathrow to Venice with British Airways, I was lucky to sit in row 1 of the Club Europe cabin where you get the most legroom. Unfortunately the rest of the cabin has the same seat pitch as Euro Traveller. The seats are comfortable for a short flight and the service to around 16 passengers was good, with good quality food and drinks served."
1354,Derek Salter (South Africa) 7th September 2015,9/10,"""Problem is how inconsistent British Airways is""",Short flight from London to Paris but completely full. Easy check in and smooth boarding. Problem is how inconsistent British Airways is in regard to baggage allowed in the cabin. Some people have two or three big bags when I thought only one was allowed. So this then puts pressure on passengers with just one to put in the lockers with the crew trying to get them to put the bag by their feet. Why should they? I carry less on the plane to be able to have foot space - why should I give that up when someone else brings on more bags. This needs to be looked at. Short flight - on time and service on board ok given that timeframe.

The film choice wasn't good, and don't book seats next to the toilets, seat row numbers in the 20's you will always get served last, and they do run out."

Neil Hopkins (United Kingdom) 7th September 2015",6/10,"""space in economy is abysmal""","Las Vegas to London Heathrow with British Airways. What we were expecting and what we got are two separate things.  We boarded the aircraft on time, and were greeted at the doorway, but once inside, the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting - no help anywhere! We settled into our seats, which were narrow and very cramped, and the heat in the cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. The service commenced once the flight was underway and free drinks were offered, and if you fancied a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. The meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given - or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. This was changed when it was brought to the attention the of the crew, and looking back I think she would have been better with the wrong choice that was given, and suffered the consequences as it looked unappetising, bland and who knows what it was. No vegetables, no meat. The rest of the meals were served (or should I say thrown at us) offering pasta or chicken. The attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. For the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. One  of the screens in the seatback wasn't working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin crew being told - why aren't these things checked prior to boarding? The space you get in economy is abysmal, the person in front of me put his seat back and was nearly lying on me, the leg room is shocking and the seats uncomfortable. My son couldn't eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up as he couldn't see it. The cabin crew should make an announcement when meals are served for passengers to upright the seats out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when they're serving meals - no they don't, as it would be too much of an effort for them. The only good thing about the flight was arriving early so we could get off it. Would we fly British Airways again - on this experience no, you would have more room in a tin of sardines! British Airways need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service to everybody on the flight - not just the passengers in the posh seats, and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course."
1357,R Schröder (United Kingdom) 6th September 2015,2/10,"""Club Europe seats not fit for purpose ""","Ghastly describes the British Airways experience in a single word. The new Club Europe seats are not fit for purpose at all when it comes to a 4 hour flight. It's impossible to stretch out, because there is no space and I am only 6 foot tall. It's impossible to work, because there is insufficient space and it's impossible to relax, but the new seats barely recline. This is by no stretch of the imagination a quality airline product. For anyone prepared to pay a premium, do yourself a favour and give your money to another airline."
1358,Frye Callaghan (United Kingdom) 6th September 2015,1/10,"""never use British Airways again","I used British Airways to Hong Kong in 2012 and remember vowing to never use them again. However, as I needed to get to New York and back quickly I had to use British Airways, and I thought they may have bucked up their ideas. The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift, the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The entertainment system was terrible and limited. On the return flight, I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern, the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didn't work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later (battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside). I've decided that whenever I fly eastw I'll continue using Emirates or Singapore Airlines (both of a far higher quality than British Airways) and to the USA maybe Virgin (have to be better than BA surely?). I'll never use BA again."

1360,Marcus Hoellrich (Germany) 1st September 2015,5/10,"""our last flight with British Airways""","I can confirm what has been reported earlier about British Airways long haul flights. Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. The TV screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an IKEA couch from the 1970's. The usual food choice of ""pasta or chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. Hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! We had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight. This was definitely the last flight with British Airways."

Michael Slater (United Kingdom) 1st September 2015",1/10,"""supposed legacy airline""","Thoroughly disappointed with this supposed legacy airline. Having been delayed for an hour on my British Airways connecting flight to LHR and stuck overnight at a Heathrow hotel I was looking forward to getting going on the morning flight. Reality check. This aircraft is old and decrepit and was built in the 80s, it should have been retired long ago. A quick Google search shows that this aircraft makes up the majority of BA's longhaul fleet. The seats are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you. I am 5ft 8 and weigh 70kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me. Everything is old and looks it too. Even the staff. The seats are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath. In fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature Tropicana bottle I had put the seat pocket. Even the safety animation video looks like it was made as a school IT project by 11 year olds. Staff are cold and unfriendly, it would seem that their contracts forbid smiling of any kind. The inflight entertainment screens are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixels, it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed. They are running on brand image only and even then there's only fumes left in tank. Do not fly BA at least until they seriously upgrade their fleet."
1362,Chris Hall (Australia) 1st September 2015,2/10,"""staff amiable and present""","Plane was clean, staff amiable and present with deliveries of juice and water through the flight. Dinner on departure was fine, maybe a little dry but otherwise tasty enough.  The seatback screen was tiny but selection of entertainment was good. The picture quality was rather poor. The black mark was the pathetic breakfast - croissant was inedible. Partly frozen, tasteless and it seemed like most of the folk seated nearby did not even open the plastic wrapper. Two cups of tea and a muesli bar was ample. My wife and I were travelling on different itineraries with British Airways and this was one flight we shared. I asked 3 times for the agent to link the booking, which she did. BA computer did not perform properly so we were seated apart. No drama since the plane was only about 80% full and we sorted it out ok. This was part of a round the world ticket, so I have no idea on the ""value for money"" question for this sector."

1365,David Hookway (Canada) 30th August 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"My wife and I flew from Toronto to London (return) using BA Business Class in July of this year. This was part of a ""trip of a lifetime"" we had planned to the UK. We have never flown business class, so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. I am not sure if it was worth it at all! Toronto to London was an overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Ease of booking online was very good, Customer Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a language barrier!). Check in at Toronto was average, nothing above check in at any other counter. Lounge at Toronto very good, great food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats. Comfortable but lacking any type of space (the lie flat bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto pilot - not rude but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5) to Toronto was not really any better. The business class lounge at Heathrow was not good. Lousy food, looks very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were average .I would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after security) to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate (especially if it is in the B or C sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same seat on the return trip, so again average. Food, service etc all average. Overall, we were not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another airline). I flew Air Transat Club class 2 month prior to the UK, and I enjoyed it a lot more (and a hell of a lot cheaper!) British Airways did not impress!"
1366,Ste Morris (United Kingdom) 29th August 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"I didn't really know what to expect from this flight, it had been a couple of years since my last BA flight (Gatwick to Nice in that case) we were on our way to Lyon Airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed London. Upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. With little information given as to why. When we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for himself. What amused me was that the captain came on over the PA and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. Safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. The captain kept us informed as best he could, the cabin crew showed no effort at all. They showed no will to actually be there, they didn't check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39°C outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. Once we took off the service seemed rushed, I wasn't able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back, no so much a pitiful Ham and Cheese bun thing and a drink. There was no personal touch to it. As we were approaching Heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley (we were in the back row) was the two crew complaining about their hours. I'm flying with BA Citiflyer to Dublin in September, if the service hasn't improved I'll think twice if I really need to travel BA again."

1368,Kim Dollery (United Kingdom) 29th August 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"London to Miami return. Flew out with 5 children, one was an infant turning 2 during holiday. Had necessary booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me bookings were linked and there would be no issue. Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented ""don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing"" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. My flight closed and took off without me - despite me constantly stressing that I had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. Long story short, I was dumped on next flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children, no explanation of what was going on - people being served all around me by person who was supposed to be dealing with me, no child meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. Resulted in me being stranded at Heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. I had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled 'heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos'. Had a further 3 hour wait at the other end as all medical assistance booked had not been transferred as requested. Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami."
1369,Daniel Cook (United Kingdom) 29th August 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"I have been flying with British Airways on the LHR-GVA route for a while now, and the original excellent service has been declining. I am an Executive Club silver member and due to changes to the Executive Club I am now earning a lot less avios and tier points than I used to. Also the slimmer seats on the aircraft, in this case a rather old A319, are much less comfortable and roomy. I find it quite tight and I am not especially tall at 6ft. The cabin crew were not particularly attentive but friendly. They barely bothered with the passengers onboard even though the flight was nearly empty. Overall it is disappointing that our flag carrier is becoming more like Ryanair with every 'enhancment' they make. I have recently tried Swiss on this route and they were cheaper and provided a superior service."
1370,Kenneth Barton (Canada) 25th August 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"This was my first flight on a British Airways aircraft with the new, slimmer seats and I was quite appalled by the seat pitch (space between rows). The seat back in front of me (I was seated in 14C) was so close to my face that I could not hold up a magazine to read. I had to try to twist sideways in my seat and hold the magazine in the aisle. I passed on the light breakfast that was served because it just seemed like too much trouble to try and eat from a plastic box that would have been almost pressed against my chest. The cabin crew on my flight was very pleasant and professional and the aircraft interior was immaculate, but in the future I'll avoid British Airways within Europe. The single-aisle aircraft of Air France, which I fly regularly, are far more comfortable."
1371,Desmond Jones (United Kingdom) 25th August 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"They sold me tickets without any luggage allowance. I paid £100 to add 3 bags using their online system. When I took the return flight they charged me again. But this time double. So a reasonable £200 pound flight ended up costing me £600. I'll never fly with them again. They're more expensive than everyone else, and they've totally changed their luggage terms. What a complete rip off."
1372,Colin Pay (United Kingdom) 23rd August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,No problems on this short flight. Left and arrived on time. Drink and snack served.
1373,R Lloyd (United Kingdom) 22nd August 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Not impressed. The cabin crew lacked energy and enthusiasm. Poor service. There was also rubbish left in the pocket of the seat in front of me when I boarded the plane. There were food crumbs on the table when I unclipped it and the magazines looked well used. I expected more from British Airways. I won't be flying with them again.
1374,B Wijesinghe (United States) 20th August 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"Was upgraded at the gate from Club World to First Class on a full flight. I am a loyal BA customer since 1996, and a Gold Tier member. Was welcomed and shown my seat, and the friendly young male flight attendant put my cabin bag in the overhead bin, before I did so. The suite has been modified a bit from the B777-236, but the seat remains the same, comfortable, but with a poorly-designed footrest. I opted for the Tasting Menu for lunch. It was quite good, but the food quality was not up to Cathay Pacific or Emirates First Class standards. High Tea was quite average, due to the dry sandwiches. The washrooms were clean but minimal, and the Club World washrooms on the Upper Deck of the A380 are much nicer. Pajamas and a wash bag were offered. AVOD was good. In-flight service by the same FA was very good, but the finesse of excellent First Class service was lacking a bit. Still he was always visible throughout the flight, and that was good. Arrived on time at IAD and the bags were on the carousel quickly."
1375,B Wijesinghe (United States) 20th August 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"I have been a loyal BA customer since 1996, maintaining Gold Tier membership in recent years, and Silver Tier for many prior years. BA is consistent in the seat types it offers on its long haul fleet, but in-flight service and food can vary greatly. I connected from a Qatar Airways short haul flight in DOH to BA, at Hamad International Airport. I used the Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge and it worked out well. BA's Gate staff in DOH were clearly not familiar with the ""To Fly. To Serve"" slogan, judging by their attitude that day. Apart from a choice of water or orange juice upon boarding the Club World cabin, no service was provided on the very short hop to BAH. The flight attendants (one in particular) who served from BAH to LHR were very good. It was a Sleeper-Service, so the dinner menu was minimal, but breakfast didn't compensate well for that either. Cost-cutting was evident here. Thankfully, I didn't have to jump over anyone to access the aisle as many adjacent seats were empty. The cabin was clean, and AVOD was adequate, though it froze near LHR. The flight landed on time in LHR, but transferring through T5 was chaotic at 6:30 am. Baggage transfer was good."
1376,Mark Cowell (United Kingdom) 20th August 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,"Easy check in at T5 and good passport/security/gate transit. Flight boarded 20/25 mins late due to issues with airbridge. BA WT+ cabin in good order with nice welcome aboard. AVIOS worked, must have been lucky. Young flight crew, so I assume new MF types, so not that much interaction, but non the less efficient. Food 8/10 for both dinner and breakfast. Flight made up some time so nearly on schedule. Bags first of carousel, so all in all a good travel experience."
1377,Emma L Robson (United Kingdom) 20th August 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"We flew with British Airways to St Lucia on flight number BA2159 on 28/7/15 and returned on flight number BA2158 on 9/8/2015. The journey to St Lucia was pleasant enough as we were upgraded from economy to premium economy due to spare seats. Unfortunately however the upgrade meant that my husband and I no longer had seats together (as I has with the seats I'd pre-booked) and as this was our honeymoon this was quite important for us. The journey home however was extremely disappointing. On finding our seats we discovered that the plane had not been cleaned since the previous journey. There were empty sweet wrappers in the pocket and crumbs all over the seat and on the floor. We were not offered a new pillow and blanket and instead we're left the ones used by previous customers. In my case blanket scrunched up on floor with pillow on top. In comparison with other long haul flights we have travelled on with Virgin and Emirate,s British Airways seemed to provide much less space and poorer facilities. Needless to say the flight was an uncomfortable one for many reasons. On future holidays we will be returning to other flight operators."
1378,Alan Thompson (United Kingdom) 20th August 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,Ground handling is not great at Bari but once on board was quickly forgotten. Great flight with attentive cabin crew. Delicious afternoon tea with unlimited Champagne. Very good experience.
1379,Hiba Ahmed (Belgium) 20th August 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"Very nice and helpful staff in Terminal 5, very nice and friendly cabin crew. Food was good too. Very smooth flight and on time. I have flown 6 times in last two weeks with different flights and I was flying with my 3 year old son. British Airways was the only flight where the cabin crew came from time to time came to ask if my child needed anything. She brought him a bag with a colouring book and pens without asking."
1380,J Stower (United Kingdom) 15th August 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"Our return flight from Barbados to England was delayed by 25 hours. The experience at the airport was dreadful - initially told that we would be updated every 15 minutes (that was the only update!) stuck airside with no food (all food outlets and shops shut), a free for all when some bottles of water arrived. Inability of BA ground staff to communicate with immigration (a walk of about 6 feet or a phone call), chaos when trying to give immigration cards back to hot, tired, thirsty and hungry passengers. The positive in all this was being put up in a hotel. Again - lack of communication. I was never contacted directly - people in the group were updated by BA on twitter. great if you have internet/twitter.  Despite putting in a claim from BA for flight delay I have not yet had a response from a human being. Not sure re star ratings - this site does not appear to let me put a Zero star rating."

Ian Eaton (Saudi Arabia) 14th August 2015",4/10,British Airways customer review,"Flight was picked because it got us from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Newcastle, UK in a reasonable amount of time. What BA failed to inform anyone was that despite advertising the flight from RUH to LHR as landing at 5.25am BST at LHR is that planes cannot land at LHR before 6am. So once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the Newcastle flight. We made it and got to Newcastle only to find that our two suitcases were there but my golf bag which I had paid for did not make that flight. It did make the next flight to Newcastle but I had already had to set off to make an appointment some 170 miles from Newcastle. It took 3 days for my golf bag to arrive at where I was staying. Not one word of apology from BA. The seats on the flights were ok, service of crew satisfactory, the headsets didn't work from RUH to LHR and I tried three sets. Best part was the hot bacon sandwich between LHR and NCL."
1382,Antonis Asprakis (United States) 14th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I have been a long time supporter of BA, but they have successfully managed to degrade the economy product to such an appalling level that I suspect that US based carriers now offer a better product. From ridiculously expensive fees to book seats in advance, to child-sized low quality meals on board, to planes on our route that only offer the dense 3-3-3 configuration, and new policies limiting the amount of Avios you can earn with economy tickets, I have had enough. My partner and I left both the transatlantic flight to LHR from PHL, as well as the LHR to TXL flight absolutely starving. A very sad state of affairs for BA."
1383,Yvonne Attridge (United Kingdom) 13th August 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"What on earth has happened to British Airways inflight meals? On our way out to Rome, we were told that the plane had to be changed, so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it I thought well, OK, maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes so no hot meals available. However, on our return, not only did we have an hour delay (still not sure why that happened, we were traveling with a 1 year old baby, so it was quite stressful just waiting around), but on our flight our ""meal"" was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce, they said chicken was in it, but I didn't have any in mine. That was it, no hot drink either, the drinks trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink, or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling. I'm not a fussy person, but I thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot, I didn't have time to eat anything at the airport, and arrived home at midnight, I was starving."
1384,R Gudavalli (United States) 12th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled on August 8th when there was a power outage at London Heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. Finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with BA again.
1385,M Nal (United Kingdom) 11th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Flying out on Sunday received call from BA saying they are changing aircraft from A380 to B777 so were asking passengers if they could fly out earlier. I couldn't and there was no pressure to do so by the friendly agent. Check in at Dulles smooth, lounge surprisingly very nice (much above your usual state side) and opposite BA gate. Aircraft B777 full flight, probably around 100 business class passengers so too many to know by name and no effort was made by cabin crew. Seats cramped (as expected). Did not eat on board as had dined in the lounge. A few drinks, part of a film then tried to get some sleep on the 7 hour flight. Landed earlier then expected but then had to wait half hour for luggage . Overall Cabin Crew very good, aircraft clean. Nowadays if I fly First with BA I expect Business and if I fly Business I expect Economy plus. That way I'm not disappointed."
1386,John Simonyan (Italy) 11th August 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,"Where shall I start, 4 hours delay or the days without my luggage? I came to Nassau for my wedding, me, my wife and our 3 best friends. We arrived to Nassau on Tuesday with 4 hours delay, but the most annoying part just begun. Our wedding was on Friday, me and my wife were without luggage until Thursday, due to hell knows what was going on in BA, my best mate, didn't receive his luggage for a week, and on my wedding he was best man, so I had to give him cloths to wear. We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry. BA, you almost ruined my wedding, you ruined all my friends staying, he received his bag on a last day vacation. All BA flight to Nassau that week were all delayed, from 2 to 6 hours. Never, ever again."
1387,Mary J Dinan (Ireland) 11th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"This was my first time on a long haul flight with British Airways. I found the seats to be very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen was almost in my face. She refused to put it back when we asked politely. She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone, then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like tea and if all was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy. Previously I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline. I would have no hesitation in recommending British Airways."
1388,David Stones (United Kingdom) 11th August 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,"I fly 95% for pleasure and often take advantage of Avios reward flights coupled with BA Amex companion offers and with careful planning, we seem to always find something in business for my wife and I and then pay for our 6 yr old boy, which given his age, has to include the half term and summer holiday periods. My best experience recently was flying the to Las Vegas on an ageing B747, but this was overcome by the decision to offer us the option of sitting in the ""Old"" First Cabin, which my wife and I took full advantage of and was very comfortable, quiet and private. We did the same on the way back, but because of an aircraft change we found ourselves flying in a refurbished New First which was the icing on the cake (all of this for just £2000 each in the BA sale). This type of service can also be repeated on short haul with excellent food for an airline. My only gripes are the use of tiny A319's on the Paphos route which is too small a plane for such a long route and I'm not a big fan of the decision to reduce legroom in the new Club Europe, however the exclusion of the middle seat does give enough room for you legs. Having flown with Qantas and Emirates in Y Class recently I genuinely don't believe they are much further ahead of BA, my A380 experience on Qantas was distinctly ordinary for a premium product."
1389,Sean Patterson (United States) 11th August 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"Staff was helpful in both cities. The plane was on the older side, but clean. The tv's were not the biggest, but a wide selection of movies, tv shows, and music. The seats were comfortable and a good amount of legroom. The service was great and flight attendants attentive, food was good."
1390,A Wade (United Kingdom) 6th August 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"A pleasant trip with British Airways as usual but suffered a 60 minute delay, for which the Captain apologised for when we boarded. Inflight entertainment was on mainscreen and showed a range of programs and the onboard service was good, especially as it was a jam packed flight. However, these planes are rather old and neither my seat nor the one next to me had a working headphone jack. British Airways is a standard airline, but not as good as other major scheduled airlines. I find it tends to be rather hit and miss when it comes to the quality of cabin crew and aircraft."
1391,Keith Giddard (United Kingdom) 6th August 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,"If Brirish Airways honestly thinks they are a premium, quality airline they need a look at people like myself who have had one after another bad experiences - arrogance, trading on past glories, old cabins, high prices, the list goes on. I booked a flight to Florence through BA website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that I was flying with Vueling. Never heard of them. To cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours, nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally got there, one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left Italy yet. We informed the ground staff. They did not day a thing. After half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. I headed straight back the the terminal and sought a British Airways rep to try and get an answer, firstly because that is who I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no representation at the airport. I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't help. I explained the situation again and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer Service Representative' walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him. He looked at me as if I had 2 heads and in the end walked away after calling me an 'ar----le'. 100% true, in the middle of Gatwick North Terminal. My wife and 6 week old child were themselves waiting at Florence 4 hours for me. We were told Vueling were going to try and get us out the following day. But no guarantees. I booked another flight with British Airways to get to my family, and British Airways have offered nothing, not even an apology. Vueling will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedures. British Airways should be ashamed of what they have become."
1392,Riaz Osmani (United Kingdom) 6th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,British Airways short-haul economy product is fine especially if the flight time is only 50 minutes in the air. British Airways staff are friendly and professional but why has there been such a drastic fall in standards? They try to save money by not serving you napkins with the drink. And the drinks come in plastic cups that could have been more stylish. Little things like these tell a lot about an airline. But at least drinks and snacks were free.
1393,M Hatoum (Canada) 6th August 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"British Airways charged me $100.00 for a ""too large"" carry on leaving my destination, even though I used the same carry on traveling to my destination without charge and have never been charged for this carry on - it fit into the carry on size check in front of his eyes but he continued to tell me that it was too big and I needed to be charged. I had to call and email multiple times to get this investigated and which point they told me that day your carry on was too large and you needed to pay the fine, no refund. Will never fly with this company again."
1394,Michelle Bennett (Australia) 6th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"From the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a 24 hour flight, I am thoroughly disappointed with British Airways. My husband and I travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from London to Sydney together. I phoned British Airways 3 days before my flight from London to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. I was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. However if I wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. I was not giving this money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so I refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. When online check in opened my husband and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. This woman did not even work for British Airways but was the most helpful. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. The cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in Economy. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane). I will only be flying with Emirates or Singapore Airlines in the future who know how to look after their passengers."
1395,Daniel Wilkie (United Kingdom) 4th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I am a Silver Card Holder, work in aviation and fly around 3-4 times a week. Up to 2 months ago I was loyal to BA as it is an 'English Airline with English Values' but this loyalty was unfounded. My main issue now with BA is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. On frequent trips to Dubai with BA on a 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that BA has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. The seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. The arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. The inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. On short haul flights, in business (LHR-MUN), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. The seats are lightweight. Uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room, the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without AC on. My worst experience was trying to fly back to Munich from London. It was an old A320. As we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. On landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. This I feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100 + passengers off as the last flight to London departed. We then had to stand around for 2 Hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. Next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. I would not recommend BA at present, even the new A380 I flew on to LA had so many faults and badly thought through. I will miss the easy access of Terminal 5 and lounges that I earned through loyalty as many other customers do. However the age, quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care has lost me as a customer."
1396,Nigel Diepering (South Africa) 4th August 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"I am a regular user of BA and generally find the airline to be OK but not outstanding. This flight was fairly full , departed on time and check in was very quick. In my opinion the 747 fleet of BA needs either replacement of extensive refurbishment, these aircraft are all old and look it in the interior. The seats were past their prime and quite uncomfortable. The food offering was very poor, no fresh items either at dinner or for breakfast. Staff were OK, punctuality was good and baggage delivery although not fast was acceptable. Inflight entertainment was good but the TV screens are from a previous age with quite poor quality"
1397,Nigel Diepering (South Africa) 4th August 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,"The flight left on time and arrived early, which was great. The B747-400 fleet of BA needs either replacement or complete refit of the interiors. The aircraft was old and looked it. The food was pretty standard but compared with our earlier Cape Town to London flight much better and more complete, why the lack of consistency is unclear. The inflight entertainment offering is good but the TV screens are small and worn delivering poor quality images. Staff were excellent, efficient and friendly and went out of their way to make the journey more pleasant"

Mike Bullen (United Kingdom) 4th August 2015",8/10,British Airways customer review,"The outgoing flight was fine, the return flight was cancelled due to an issue with the plane. I understand this happen as I am a seasoned traveller, however what happened next was unacceptable and what you would expect from a low class airline. We were handed tickets for an American Airlines flight from a different O'Hare terminal and told ""you have to go now"". The terminal was in chaos and travelling from the international terminal to terminal three took one hour. Getting boarding passes and going again through security was another hour or so but the flight was delayed and left two hours late. Flight was very mediocre and not what I had paid for with BA. We arrived in London and guess what - no bags, even though we spent more than 5 hours in Chicago Airport and were assured our bags were on the flight. That was Sunday now it is Tuesday, no on has contacted us and no updates."
1399,David George (United Kingdom) 4th August 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"The seat that I had booked 24 hours in advance (a window seat) had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin, I complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full. Once onboard I discoverd that the interior was worn and the seats very uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment or the VOD (video on demand) system apeared to be VHS and was broken for my seat, one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minutes. The screen was very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the in-flight entertainment was more tiring than not watching it. The food was average but seemed to match the aircraft as it was dull and tasteless. As this was an overnight flight I expected to be able to get somewhat more than a 30 min nap which was interupted, any sleep was not possible due to the fact that there was 5 infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least 3 were shrieking at any given time. The Boeing 777 should not be still used on long haul flights as it does not live up to the standards of BA's Airbus A380's or Boeing 747 flights. I had an excellent flight out on BA and an amazing stay in Washington D.C but the flight back put a dent in the enjoyment of the holiday."
1400,Eamon Callan (United Kingdom) 28th July 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything."
1401,Dave Houlihan (United Arab Emirates) 27th July 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult."
1402,A Gibson (United Kingdom) 27th July 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later."

Linda Wilson (United Kingdom) 27th July 2015",10/10,British Airways customer review,"I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing."
1404,K Weller (United Kingdom) 26th July 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"Booked for our trip to Uganda, in Feb 2015 we spent £1450 for 2 return tickets, had to pay an additional £100 to reserve seats on the flights. About 2 days ago I received a text message (not a call) saying that our flight had been cancelled - left us in the dark until I had to phone their 0844 number to get transferred to a Delhi call centre, when I was told I could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flights and not the seats on this now, non existant flight. I had to phone back a further 2 times to get through to someone that could understand that I did want my £100 as well. In a nutshell, I will not book with British Airways again,"

Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 25th July 2015",1/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew Club Europe from Istanbul to Heathrow, excellent flight with quick and easy boarding. The service was as always to a high standard with a good selection of choices for the evening meal. Entertainment was OK for the flight. Nice touch being able to leave the plan first, it can make all of the difference for the lines at T5."

Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 25th July 2015",10/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew Club Europe to Istanul on 767, boarding was speedy and boarding completed quickly for an on time departure. The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines! So come on British Airways lets go back to the old configurations where we have plenty of leg room in Club Europe and reduce the rows of seats, we do not want Low Cost Airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them, we choose BA because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standards once again."
1407,Lawrence Hunt (United Kingdom) 25th July 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,"BA seems to be losing its ability to run an airline. I have had 4 flights canclled in the last 3 months, 3 of them while I was at the gate. Every flight which does operate is delayed. Staff attitude is appallimg, they just don't seem to care. I have no compensation. My step daughter was deinied boarding due to BA overbooking. BA then messed up her rebooked flight and then lost her luggage. No apology and no compensation. Should their slogan be "" Not to Fly, Not to Serve""?"

Eric Rose (United Kingdom) 25th July 2015",1/10,British Airways customer review,"Previously a loyal BA customer, I Usually travel economy on shorthaul but I am 6'4"" with long legs and am very uncomfortable unless I can get Exit row. So on this flight I took advantage of a what I thought was a reasonably priced Club World ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch. Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as ""late breakfast"" and no wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit over customer service and I am amazed that anyone travels Club Europe. Later in the year I was due to travel to South America via Madrid in Business Class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline. In future I will avoid BA shorthaul wherever possible."
1409,Alan Thompson (United Kingdom) 23rd July 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Booked a hand luggage only fare at short notice so it was pricey. Allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of €26 to change it so didn't bother. Flight seemed to be full of families split up probably for the same reason. A ripoff. Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight. For the last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great."
1410,A Ray (Australia) 20th July 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"I might have been in economy for service, food and seating, 8 abreast. No room to move. If you are over 80kg or 6', you're squashed completely. WC clean with paper towels. Adequate IFE. The difference between older crew on prior sectors and young cabin crew on this flight was stark. They were polite and totally wooden. On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil. Club World is like a stretched Economy with a Business Class fare."
1411,M Nal (United Kingdom) 18th July 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"Concord lounge was more business class then first. Boarding smooth, aircraft clean. Didn't like the seat much, B777 the seat is closer to the windows then the A800 which is more preferable for me. Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic. Saving grace has to be BA cabin crew very polite and attentive."

Darran Burr (United Kingdom) 17th July 2015",6/10,British Airways customer review,"Having read many reviews on here I was somewhat sceptical about flying Club World with BA, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service and overall experience that we enjoyed on this 13 hour flight to Kuala Lumpur. We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380."
1413,Charles Kemp (United Kingdom) 17th July 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-BKK-LHR. Started badly with all the Ryanairesque baggage warnings at Terminal 5. BA's low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. Seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food superb, best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for £65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again."
1414,Richard Wilson (United Kingdom) 17th July 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-NCL-LHR economy on newly refitted Airbus narrowbody. The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful. Others are downright rude (as one was on this flight) Overall, BA can be great, but sometimes not so much."

Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 16th July 2015",5/10,British Airways customer review,"Recently flew BA from LHR to ORD, 64A, Upper Deck in Club World. Excellent experience with great service and a good food selection too. The crew were professional and very attentive but the ration of crew to passengers hels as there are only 20 seats on the upper deck with two dedicated crew. The seat was comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the windows was a great help too. The inflight entertainment was OK but the selection was very limited compared to what it used to be, BA could do more to add a much wider variety to its film selection, otherwise a great flight."
1416,Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 16th July 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew First Class 2A from Chicago to London, easy boarding and excellent service provided at all times by the cabin crew in First Class. The food was excellent and a good selection available too. Breakfast was good with a nice selection with plenty of organge juice and tea which came in a pot which was a lovely touch. If you are flying British Airways and connecting from an American Airlines domestic flight do note that you can now transfer from T3 to T5 at Chicago airside by shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins thus avoiding the security lines in T5, this applies only to BA Passengers tranferring from an American Airlines or American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight."
1417,Pauline James (United States) 15th July 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"I was amazed that this airline charges extra to book a seat in advance. I have never seen that on any of the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out. Pretty meager selection. If given a choice, I don't think I will fly BA after this trip is over."
1418,Robert Borman (United States) 15th July 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,"First leg CAI-LHR was on time, flight crew was pleasant, but the seating was very cramped and legroom almost non-existent. The second leg LHR-JFK wasn't much different with helpful crew but horrible seating space. My knees were pressed against the seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them one at a time. It used to be a flagship carrier but now it's not much better than a budget airline. Will do my best to avoid."
1419,N Reeves (United Kingdom) 14th July 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Travelled in party of four with prebooked seating 4 abreast outbound, 2 abreast inbound. Cabin clean, well presented and tidy with good welcome. Not a full flight but approx 80% loading. The level of service from cabin staff was excellent. Service got underway quickly with full choice of menu and drinks available. Good, clear and short information from flight deck. Toilets were clean and tidy throughout flight. Lights dimmed two and a half hours into flight to allow rest with water rounds taking place by cabin crew. Good English breakfast served 1.5 hours out of JNB. Return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep. Food did not seem to be of such a good standard on this leg. BA on these flights provided excellent service and we were impressed. TV screens a little too small."

Andrew Ray (Australia) 9th July 2015",5/10,British Airways customer review,"Same tired plane back to London. Ground and cabin staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful. A first on this series of flights. Flew on the same plane on the way from LHR to IST (see other recent reviews). Moved to row 1 for more space. Still sub-standard and why, why put economy seats in business class? Lounge was crammed and noisy pre-flight. I joined Star Alliance as a Gold Member so at least got to see the Miles and Smiles lounge. BA, look around don't rest on last century's efforts. I've flown BA First but just wouldn't any more. Responding to Skytrax reviews may just help increase profits. I must say, apart from the cheery crew on BA 677, the polite but totally disinterested service (when it exists) and old, cramped cabins will be my memory of this business trip."
1421,Paul Nesbitt (Thailand) 9th July 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"All I can say is mediocre. Having flown this route with other airlines in business class, I believe I have been spoilt. The British Airways product is old and just adequate. TV screen small and poor quality, food okay but nothing more, seating poor. The one highlight was quality of service from the crew. I had nothing to actually complain about, but nothing to make me want to use this product again."
1422,Ash Aryan (Ireland) 8th July 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"I have been flying between Dublin and London once every 2 weeks on average since the beginning of the year, and I have regularly used British Airways at the beginning. However, I have found their new policy of asking for £15 for seat selection (even at check-in) really annoying, unnecessary and insulting to loyal customers. Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow selection at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks etc) extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector. If they continue their money-grabbing policy I will definitely and happily give more of my business to Aer Lingus and Cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows."
1423,A Ray (Australia) 7th July 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"Uncomfortable, serviceless, low class. I had low expectations and they weren't met. Club World has gone from leading to lagging. Cramped pods (8 seats across when others have 6), and a tired old plane. I usually fly in an aisle seat but know better on BA, so was in a window seat. The passenger next to me was repeatedly woken as food was handed over or spilt on him. After the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. Only one bottle of water all flight. The food was tasteless, overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiments reminded me of fast food chain. At the price this is the worst product in the skies. Seat was broken and IFE clunky. Being used to CX, QF, SIA, Finnair, Air Tahiti Nui, AA, Lan Chile and more, I hesitate to call it business class because it isn't."
1424,A Ray (Australia) 7th July 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"Expected Club world got Club Europe - the same as Economy on any decent airline. Food was okay, plied with alcohol if you wanted it. Must be the oldest aircraft in the fleet. No IFE other than a 24"" screen for the cabin. Was told by the ground crew that my qualifying international cabin bag needed to be checked in, not happy. It's been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. My colleague had the same. Officious and uncalled for. Exactly the same cabin bags were rolled aboard 4 days later on the return flight. Seats were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airlines. Why pay for Club Europe business class when you don't get it?"
1425,A Ray (Australia) 7th July 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I managed to switch to upstairs on the 744, so happy as it is a quiet space. Seat 64A footstool was broken, so the night was uncomfortable. We left Singapore around midnight and got into LHR at 0441hrs, so sleep was intermittent as I tried to adjust the seat to compensate. Food out of Singapore was okay but still lacking. One pleasant attendant, one grumpy. No Fast Track on landing because we got in early, so queue with coach tours. I'm stuck on British Airways this trip but won't be booking by choice again."
1426,Angela Chadwick (United Kingdom) 6th July 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"Adult meals ran out, just sausage and potato left, no children's meals available! Return flight delayed by 7 hours as plane was not in a safe condition. Scheduled flight at 8pm departed at 3.30am! They had to fly one in to Orlando all the way from Cardiff - a bad joke. No children's meals available."
1427,Ben Millard (United Kingdom) 6th July 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"Very good all business class flight, only issue experienced was the slow bag delivery upon arrival in JFK. Food exceptional and service provided was good. The seats were full flat. Ipad provided for inflight entertainment, with several films, tv shows etc. A good flight albeit a little expensive."
1428,Ronald Pinto (United Kingdom) 5th July 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"Once British Airways review their seating facilities, I will use the airline again. The seats are so cramped and when the passenger in front decided to recline his seat that was it, no matter how much I asked him to recline back, he would not do it. Only when the food arrived did he move his seat - and to add insult to injury the food tasted vile, and ended up eating the bread roll only. I will use BA now as a last option."
1429,Geraldine Marshall (United Kingdom) 5th July 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew back 30 June, LGW-MCO flight delayed at Gatwick for 8 hours. Got told at 13.55 when flight was supposed to leave that there was a technical fault and they were bringing in a new aircraft from Cardiff, told to report back at 15.15 to be told that still not here and to report back later and given £10 voucher. Told we would take off at 17.15 Come 17.15 got told they needed to try and get a crew. Did not depart until after 9pm. It was our tenth wedding anniversary not one member of staff said anything (I spoke with back duty office the day before and was told they would arrange a glass of champagne inflight). Boarded aircraft which was a very old 777, no champagne, no duty free and no kids packs. My IFE had to be rebooted."
1430,John Duffus (Thailand) 28th June 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1 business, 1 economy. As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31"", BA has lost my future business."

Thomas Kingston (United Kingdom) 28th June 2015",2/10,British Airways customer review,After my flight to Vienna with BA I was hoping for a slight improvement on the way back - however the service was very boring. Drink service was rushed with the stewardess pouring an entire miniature of vodka into a drink before putting a drop of Tomato juice in when I asked for a Tomato and Vodka - unpalatable. Was glad to be off the plane in all fairness. Hoping that one day BA will wow me.

Thomas Kingston (United Kingdom) 28th June 2015",3/10,British Airways customer review,Slightly disappointing flight in an aircraft that was showing it's age. It seems very little effort is put into cabin decor meaning it looks quite tawdry in all fairness. Food was okay - ham and cheese croissant - but nothing to write home about. Seats weren't great for someone my height and all in all I was left feeling underwhelmed - budget level offerings at a high price
1433,Andrew Hickling (United Kingdom) 27th June 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-FCO and return outbound A321 new Club Europe seating, return Boeing 767. I've not flown Club Europe for some years and wasn't looking forward to the flight due to the new seat pitch which is the same as economy. I was fortunate on both journeys to secure a seat in row 1 where you do have extra legroom. The only other seat with extra leg room is the emergency exit row. The food and drink selection was good and the service from the crew was excellent on the return leg."
1434,John Gray (United Kingdom) 26th June 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up. Post-flight I found the BA customer complaints dept to be dreadful, and left me far more disappointed with the service than at the end of my flights."
1435,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 26th June 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"Flight home was as good as the flight out. Had long delay to depart, in part from a missing passenger who checked in, then disappeared - one of those mysteries about airline travel that happens from time to time.  Meanwhile a full plane of passengers were delayed in total by 90 mins. A320 was newly refurbished and clean. So called ""new"" Club Europe seats were installed, and as I was in row 1 it was okay. The menu was identical to the outbound and the beef main course was was terrific. It was the sort of meal that I would have happily paid £20 for in a quality bistro. FAs were great. The Chinese FA was the sort that understand customer service. Her colleague was closer to retirement and seemed to be on another planet most of the time. At the half way point I wanted another gin and tonic, but they had run out of both ice and proper ""glasses"". On arrival to LHR we were parked miles away from the Terminal. No reasons was given. All in all, a very good experience."
1436,Andrew Coogans (United Kingdom) 26th June 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"Once boarded there was a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot. The cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. Once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. Seating on A319 was comfortable for a short flight. At GLA Airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance. This is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway, especially on a late night arrival. One sees Easyjet and Ryanair passengers passing through the arrivals process much quicker."
1437,John Reed (United Kingdom) 25th June 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"Disappointed. The food was poor, my wife's steak could have been anything, my curry had a tiny piece of chicken. The cabin was less than half full but cabin crew hadn't time to bring a glass of wine. After the meal, staff disappeared. No after dinner drink offered, no refreshments during the night. For the price this could have been a lot better. Return on old B747 was better."
1438,Aaron Edy (United Kingdom) 22nd June 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,"This is my 3rd flight with BA in 8 months and  the worst yet. The customer service and communication is appalling. Originally my return flight was from Rome to London Gatwick but my flight was cancelled due to issues at Rome airport. But instead of BA getting in contact with me in regards to this, the third party company I booked the flights with had to. When Checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. When I  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though I called the Customer Service number. This is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service was good which is surprising. But as a result of the rudeness, lack of communication and appalling customer service I'm very unlikely to ever use them again."
1439,Roger Stone (Australia) 21st June 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"British Airways never fails to surprise. I find the business lounge in Geneva quite reasonable and on this last occasion was impressed with the manner in which the Lounge Manager handled a cranky passenger who was accusing him of destroying her favourite newspapers. Then, once on-board, I discovered that Business Class on some of BA's European routes have a seat-pitch that almost prevents gaining entry to the window seats! For those used to flying Qantas domestic economy in Australia think of a forward seat in economy with the middle seat kept empty: and that's it! On the other hand, service and food was excellent and the flight crew commentary was superb. BA have an excellent in-flight magazine."
1440,Richard Vines (United Kingdom) 16th June 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"I flew from Seoul to London, business class and was surprised how much better the food was than in first. It was interesting and enjoyable and attractively presented. If only BA would abandon the bizarre seat configuration in business, it would be very good. The service was OK, if a bit inattentive, but it is embarrassing to have the attendants slide down the screen every time you need anything. You find your face inches away from that of a stranger. Fortunately, I now know which seats to pick to avoid climbing over my neighbour to reach the aisle."
1441,Nazira Khatun (United Kingdom) 14th June 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,"I flew out on the 8th June 2015 and all I can say is that the staff, flight and service was excellent. We had a little issue with the flights as the people we booked it with made an error on our tickets but BA sorted this out in no time. I will definitely be flying out with them again and I will recommend them. Service on the plane was excellent."

Nur Afiqah Rahmat (United Arab Emirates) 14th June 2015",10/10,British Airways customer review,"I fly with this airline almost every other weekend from Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Throughout (I think so far 7 trips with them), they have never had any delays with me, and even if there has been, it would be a maximum 30 minutes (and still be able to arrive in Muscat on time). Staff are professional, yet friendly enough to chat to. It would be excellent if there was a flight from Muscat to Abu Dhabi at an earlier time (the only ones available now is one that arrives at midnight). The only downside to this airline is that the Highlife shopping is not available for that Abu Dhabi - Muscat due to the short duration, even if you booked and paid for the items online and were hoping for an onboard delivery."
1443,J Harrison (Canada) 14th June 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Ended up on a 25-year-old 747, the second-oldest in BA's fleet, and boy did it show. The cabin was seriously dated and in need of a good renovation, but I guess this aircraft will be retiring any day soon. The outbound flight was on a nicely retrofitted 777 with comfortable spacious chairs and excellent, clear and larger IFE screen. The screens on this 747 were tiny and and very poor resolution by comparison. Nevertheless, the service was usual good BA standard: courteous and efficient, with decent enough food (better than in past years, when revolting soggy pasta seemed to be the norm). Despite the ancient and not-up-to-standard aircraft, the flight was pleasant enough."
1444,Steve Gatenby (United Kingdom) 13th June 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,"We were boarded quickly but suffered a weather delay of over an hour because of localised thunderstorms. Throughout this time, the cockpit crew kept passengers updated and after about 30 mins water/juice were offered before being advised that we would soon be cleared to depart. The cabin was clean and the crew friendly and polite with apologies about the delay. Breakfast snack just ok but only a short flight. In my view BA in general do short haul well, but really need to improve their long haul product."
1445,Andrew Gascoyne (United Kingdom) 12th June 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Terrible. Flight time is well over 2 hours. Seating is like Ryanair, but we are talking BA Club Europe. Which genius decided that 30 inch is sufficient for premium passengers? No idea what to do with my legs. It's impossible to use my laptop. This is not business class. Very uncomfortable flight, especially for the money I paid. BA - rethink!"
1446,James Williamson (United Kingdom) 12th June 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"28th May 2015, LHR-DEN, B747, Seat 29A.  Paid £55 extra for Legroom seat which was good though the width is very narrow.  Lady in seat next to me kept fidgeting And her arm kept twitching into mine the whole flight which was annoying.  Flight was on time and cabin crew were all very friendly.  Food also was pretty good for economy.  747 is really showing her age now, though the cabin was clean, tidy and in good condition, it was old in style and very noisy.  The entertainment system is also quite long in the tooth with a small, blurry, screen.  Pretty good flight though."
1447,James Williamson (United Kingdom) 12th June 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"9/6/15, ORD-LHR, 777-300, Club World, Seat 13b.  Had booked as World Traveler Plus but was upgraded pretty close to departure. This meant I did not have any time to get a meal before hand and the meal on board was both small and not very good.  Would have been better with the economy mean I think. Breakfast was pretty poor as well with
several items not given out. Other than that the crew were excellent and very attentive.  The seat was full lie flat though pretty narrow I thought compared to other carriers Business class. Entertainment system was also very good and up to date."
1448,James Williamson (United Kingdom) 12th June 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,"10/6/15, LHR-GLA, A321, Seat 9A.  Was able to choose this seat in advance which has plenty of legroom as no seat in front.  Flight was pretty full.  Cabin crew were all extremely friendly and helpful welcoming every passenger individually.  Flight was delayed by difficulty in storing the silly amount of carry on baggage people brought on board.  Some stuff was obviously way bigger than the allowed size.  It took ages to get it all sorted which was ridiculous, however the crew kept smiling though it all.  Again new configuration seating which I found pretty comfortable.  Drink and snack was served as usual.  Landed nearly 30 mins late to discover my baggage had not made it from GRR which was quite annoying.  Overall good flight though."
1449,James Williamson (United Kingdom) 12th June 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,"28 May 2015, GLA-LHR. A321 (new Seating) Seat 4A.  Flight was on time and about half full.  I've read complaints about the new seating however found it to be comfortable and roomy.  Drink and snack service was fine and the cabin crew were all very friendly."
1450,Tarun Thadani (Singapore) 7th June 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Worst customer experience on BA flight. I have a confirmed flights for British Airways from Singapore to Sydney for tomorrow. When I tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online check-in. I called the BA contact center in the UK and was shocked with the response received. The person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating. Essentially BA wants to sell their seats at a premium. They arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesn't mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation. We are travelling as a family but got scattered seats. Very embittered with the overall experience. Will never fly again with British Airways.
1451,Thomas Varughese (Canada) 7th June 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,I had this terrible experience of traveling British Airways from Heathrow to Calgary. The plane was parked in a no-mans area and we were bussed to the plane. To my horror I had to climb through the stairs with my carry on bag! The width of the seat and the leg space is the smallest I saw in my 40 years of travel experience. It's a shame that that the airline is using this kind of carrier for a Transatlantic flight. The quality of food is one of the worst I have ever seen. I picked the non-veg chicken item the taste and content was hopeless. The container was marked for expiry as 28/11/16 07.53 an expiry after 18 months but marked for the hour and minute. The only positive thing I can think of in this torture for 9 hours is the attitude and service of the cabin crew they were great.
1452,A Anderson (United Kingdom) 7th June 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"BA362 6th June 2015. If this were the first flight I had taken with British Airways I would not be impressed. At check in there is a lack of professionalism. The customer does not come first even at the First Class check in. Staff interrupt each other and discuss their own business in priority to completing the check in. The flight was in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such as was provided given as ""ten minutes"". The aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumbs on the seat and grease marks on the windows. The inflight shopping was made difficult as there were no inflight duty free magazines available in Club Class. Inflight entertainment system did not work. Whilst the food was good it had to be changed as the first offering was cold. Inflight crew were pleasant and efficient. Upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passengers."
1453,R Vines (United Kingdom) 7th June 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,I flew from Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda in First. The Concorde Lounge at Heathrow was quite good though I was surprised by how little choice there was when it came to food. The seat on the new First was good. The service was all right. The food on board was poor as it has been each time I've flown First over the years. To find something edible I had to retreat to the snack bar in business. I was particularly disappointed because BA is still my first choice for economy and it is fine in business apart from the bizarre seating configuration.
1454,David Ellis (United Kingdom) 6th June 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,HER-LGW. Our return flight confirmed our view that Club Europe is a waste of money on this new route. HER is infamous as a relic of the 70s and BA have done nothing to improve that. Check-in was interminable despite a Club Europe desk. There was a fast track option for security but this was roped off for our flight. No lounge was offered even though there are lounges available and used by other airlines. Not surprisingly there was no priority boarding. Our seats 2D and 2E are the only decent seats in the new Club Europe. Service on board was adequate. LGW was the usual nightmare taking 45 minutes to crawl through the boarder control fiasco. We certainly wouldn't want to repeat our BA experience to and from HER.
1455,Bradley Baker (Cyprus) 6th June 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,I'm very disappointed with my BA flight as it was very poor. I was traveling from GLA Glasgow-LCA Larnaca via LHR London. On my first flight my tray table fell on it hinges. They did gives a full breakfast though. Then on the second flight the middles of the seat were full of dust and gum. Secondly the television on the 767 was broken. Finally on a 5 and a half hour flight they gave us a little chicken or vegetable wrap with a choc pud.
1456,Conrad Winchester (United Kingdom) 6th June 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,BA006 19th May 2015. Awful premium economy service - bad old cabin with faulty inflight entertainment and they even split my wife and I up when travelling back from Japan - how is that acceptable?
1457,Sean Kyte (United Kingdom) 4th June 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew Eurotraveller Heathrow to Athens and back. Both flights only slightly delayed in departing crew attentive on both sectors and being a band 4 flight hot meals provided although edible the meat on the Athens to Heathrow was indeterminable. Cabin was fairly clean on both flights however did find a boarding card from 24 hours previous in my seat pocket. Traveled with a 6 month old baby and at Heathrow and on board was looked after my only criticism which is not really BA's fault was the check in agent at Athens (swissport) was hesitant about letting our pushchair through to the gate despite my insistence this had come from London with us and hadn't been an issue then!
1458,D Evans (United Kingdom) 4th June 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from Heathrow to San Francisco on May 1st with BA. What a disappointment! I had to pay over £120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. Then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. Our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was OK typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. Four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey! Don't they stock up before picking up the next passengers? Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. Before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues. Would I fly BA again certainly not long haul although unfortunately I have to return to Heathrow with them from Boston today.
1459,George Ling (United Kingdom) 1st June 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,Flew to Tampa from Gatwick on the 12/5/15 return flight on the 25/5/15. Had flown with BA on several occasions to Mauritius. Can't believe despite the number of complaints BA received nothing has changed regarding the food the service. Admittedly some of crew are good but some of them makes you wonder why did they choose such career. BA seriously need to review the customer care they provide. Dinner overcooked frozen rolls with a cereal bar for breakfast - really tasted better food on cheaper airline. Come on BA listen to your customer and improve your service. Very disappointed with BA.
1460,Clare Roberts (United Kingdom) 31st May 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Sadly flying British Airways is no longer about a great experience - it is a seat on a flight which you pay a lot of money for. We had a number of issues that we tried to get resolved via Customer Services but were told they couldn't do anything until our journey had ended? We were very disappointed with this approach and their inability to address our issues during our journey. BA staff at Heathrow told us the wrong information about reclaiming our baggage (causing big issues) the plane was overly hot on both legs of the flight and we were told by cabin crew on both flights this is a known problem on these older planes. The breakfast on our return flight wasn't fit for consumption - an ice cold hard croissant after 7 hours of no food? Really poor service and even worse customer services.
1461,Alistair Baker (United Kingdom) 31st May 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,I treated myself to Premium Economy on my PEK-LHR flight BA38 because it was only an extra £120 and I had been on holiday to North Korea and wanted a bit of luxury. I was impressed with the legroom in the bulkhead seat and the PE cabin was not very full. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and the food was good however it seemed to be the same as the Economy food just with a fancy menu card. I was impressed with the seat recline and the footrest and I got a lot of sleep even though it was a daytime flight. The IFE malfunctioned for the first half of the flight which seems a common occurrence on BA 747s. Staff were apologetic and gave us complaint forms to fill in.
1462,Alistair Baker (United Kingdom) 31st May 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,I flew LHR-PEK for a holiday on a 747-400. The plane was not that busy and the seat next to me was free which was great. The plane was clean and my seat was reasonably comfortable. The IFE had a good selection although the small screens on the 747 now look out of date. The meal was fine for economy class and the staff were polite and attentive.
1463,Nick Rego (United States) 31st May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,First off this particular flight from EWR to LHR and back was advertised as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The actual jet was a 777 much less comfortable. The flight going to London was 3 hours delayed coming into EWR something about a diversion regarding a sick passenger in Boston MA. In fact they had not allocated a crew. Coming home my pre-paid seats were changed in premium economy to seats next to W'C's so I had the pleasure of smelling excretion and gas the whole flight. I was also emailed an offer for an upgrade then that email was followed up with one that stated that the first one was sent in error. Fact: I did get back to the USA. Reality: BA no more - never again. The problem with BA is not their cabin crews who are quite nice. The problem is that their Customer service is a joke. Cannot recommend this airline.
1464,David Hardy (United Kingdom) 29th May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-ATL-LHR. Out 3rd May. Back 12th May. First both ways. Outstanding experience. Check-in and security straight through. Concorde Lounge - quiet and comfortable- food lovely. Boarding very efficient. Superb flight-seats excellent food great IFE good. Crew brilliant. Straight through immigration. Exactly same on return. 777 both ways Will definitely fly with BA again. Could not have been better.
1465,K Tinashe (Botswana) 29th May 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,JNB-LHR BA056 May 13 2015. LHR-JNB BA055 May 23 2015 on the Airbus A380. Departed and landed on time. Friendly flight attendants and fairly comfortable seats. Food not exactly 5 star but I didn't have very high expectations either. Overall no complaints at all and I will definitely fly BA again!
1466,David Ellis (United Kingdom) 28th May 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-HER. A320 on one of BA's new tourist-orientated routes. Sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny-pinching 'new' Club Europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. If this is the way BA are going it doesn't make sense to pay the extra. They really should think again about their premium service.
1467,M Neave (United Kingdom) 28th May 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Gatwick to Florida return Flight out was quite good with an attentive crew 3 choices of meals found the seatback TV screen very small and selection of movies and audio choice was poor legroom could be a lot better too and I feel that BA need to update their B777 on this route. Return flight was delayed two hours but was informed by the airline by text and email on check-in a $9 vouches was given to buy drinks or a snack i found the food on the return flight very poor with only chicken or pasta available and the breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and jam and a raisin bar that was virtually indelible I would consider flying BA to Florida again if their prices are comparable to other carriers.
1468,K Jackson (United Kingdom) 27th May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-CUN-LGW. Husband and I had middle seats both outbound and return. We found seats comfortable for seating and sleeping. Crew on outbound were a lot more efficient and friendlier than the inbound crew where the service was a bit haphazard and one particular crew member who was a few years older than the others was rather offhand and didn't smile much at all. Outboard there were empty seats all around us so we did not have to sit face to face with strangers or climb over anyone when leaving our seats but cabin was quite full inboard so we did not enjoy the flight as much. The Club World cabin is definitely cramped compared with other business class cabins and I do not know what BA were thinking when they decided to pack in so many seats and in such a way as to make it very awkward for less mobile passengers to exit their seats. Storage space is lacking around the seats due to BA trying to fit too many passengers into too small a space. I would not say I would not travel Club World with BA again but would look at alternative airlines with different cabin layouts first.
1469,P Herman (United Kingdom) 27th May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Gatwick-Naples returning Barcelona-Gatwick. Excellent flights as usual. Especially loved the stylish and comfortable interiors of the refitted A319 on the Naples run. Both flights left late but it didn't seem to seriously affect arrival time. Only complaint is the food/drinks service sandwich is not to my taste and I now refuse them - but other passengers seem pleased. Should offer an alternative such as crisps or nuts to go with wine.
1470,P Evans (United States) 20th May 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,BA seem to be trying harder ground customer service much more friendly professional and efficient. T5 helps as it is a great terminal. Flew premium economy LHR to Denver flight sold out so got upgraded to Prem Economy. Positives : Small cabin between 1st class and Business makes it very exclusive and quiet (747 config 1) with no through traffic of other passengers. Upgraded service - welcome drink newspaper hot towel menu noise cancelling headphones upgraded blanket and much better food than economy (steak) bread selection etc. One flight attendant for the whole cabin but he was super efficient. Flight Attendant was excellent - friendly professional with none of the BA attitude that some have. Toilet just for premium economy. Negatives: 747 aircraft is old and you can feel that. Inflight entertainment is ancient small screen limited selection in both video and music Seat space and functionality good but not Air NZ. Toilet hygiene remains BA achilles heel - they just don't keep them clean vs. Asian airlines. This product is much improved from previous times I have taken it.
1471,S Carver (Spain) 20th May 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,Madrid-London City return. Excellent experience. Flights on time in fact 25 minutes early into LCY and arrival and departure procedures at both MAD and LCY fast and efficient. The Velazquez Lounge at MAD T4 is extremely comfortable and well-appointed with a good range of food and drink. Flight on a newish Embraer aircraft clean comfortable and spacious. Outstanding service from the two friendly English and Spanish speaking cabin crew. Full English breakfast with champagne and orange juice on the outbound and a nice chicken dinner with good wines on the return.
1472,Kathleen Lee (Switzerland) 20th May 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Our flight on economy long distance from the Austin to Heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class. A huge disappointment.
1473,Y Karanjia (India) 20th May 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"BA 138 13/5/2015. BA 273 13/5/2015. Just completed my first BA Flight in Club World. The experience can be summed up in a single word - ""pathetic"". The flight taxied and took off with passengers sleeping with their seats flat in the centre ""couples seat"". The crew was totally indifferent. The light meal post take off was offered only to passengers in the aisle seats for reasons best known to the crew. If you are seated in the centre ""couple seats"" you have to be either an acrobat or a gymnast to access the toilets as you have to jump over a sleeping passenger in the aisle to get there. The buggy requested to transport us to the lounge at Heathrow as my wife had just had surgery showed up but the lady driving it decided we did not need it and walked off as a result we had to trek for 2 hrs to clear security and reach the lounge. Will never travel BA again."
1474,Ian Robinson (United Kingdom) 20th May 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,LGW - Antigua - LGW. Easy check in at the Club World desk and then quickly through security etc. Unusually for BA at Gatwick boarding was very well organised and we were quickly on board the ageing 777 - 200. Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey. The cabin crew overall were very professional and as a result we had a good flight. The return flight was pretty much the same although despite being being bronze exec card holders we were refused permission to check in at the Club World desk which as it turned out didn't make any difference. Overall another good experience with BA bar the few issues that I have mentioned.
1475,Jerry Wiseman (United Kingdom) 20th May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Over the last couple of years I have travelled to China by Emirates KLM Virgin Atlantic and BA. The next time I travel BA will be my last choice. I got the impression from the very start that BA are penny pinching at every opportunity. Their lounges are basic and the food minimal. Although having a seat on the plane only a few row down from the front some meal selections had run out. The cabin staff hid behind curtains most of the flight therefore service was at a minimum. If you have a window seat you have to straddle the person in the inside seat if you need to get out.
1476,Y Fox (United Kingdom) 20th May 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled from Heathrow to Washington in April on one of the new A380 planes. Extremely impressed with the plane even in economy the seats are quite spacious and the storage buckets at the side of the seat are a big plus. The service on board was good and the meals were pretty good. The plane arrived exactly on time too! All in all one of the best flights I've had.
1477,D Chamberlain (United Kingdom) 20th May 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,LHR to Istanbul - excellent service on the outbound flight on what was a very busy flight. Cabin crew worked very hard and consistently. Good management on the ground and for boarding excellent cabin crew. T5 lounge ok but breakfast food soon ran out and rather slow in service.
1478,D Chamberlain (United Kingdom) 20th May 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,Brilliant service from the cabin crew and Captain/First Officer on this much delayed Lisbon-LHR flight. BA have questions to answer - another Lisbon-LHR flight which was heavily delayed (this happens regularly) another BA flight from Lisbon with a remote boarding location and poor management prior to boarding. Our two hour delay - all after we had boarded - was handled brilliantly by the crew with regular communication refreshments and as jovial atmosphere as was possible. But BA must face up to the astonishingly poor lounge in Lisbon the poor management of boarding and a limp response to questions.
1479,W Coenik (Australia) 20th May 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,Business class. Scheduled to fly from Rome to Gatwick on 7 May on BA2543. The day that the fire broke out at Rome airport. We had a 12.45pm flight. I received a text from BA at 6.30am advising of flight cancelled due to the fire and to contact BA. I called them and they rebooked us on flight BA555 at 8.15pm but direct to Heathrow. We accepted the flight change considering and lounged around Rome for the morning. Than when about to get the train to Rome airport received a text from BA advise that flight had been changed to Naples and if we wanted that flight to make our way to Naples. So we high tailed it onto a train and in 2 hours we were in Naples. The flight did not leave till 9.30pm as they were waiting on others who had made the trip to Naples and out of 152 seats on the plane about 130 people made the trip to Naples. I think the communication and the effect that BA did to get us out of Rome under the circumstances was excellent. A friend was flying to Paris from Rome on another airline and he was delayed till midnight and his luggage was not to accompany them and was delivered 2 days later to him. Once on board in Euro Business class it was all pamper. The meal was excellent of rockmelon with truffle infused coleslaw and BBQ style prawns. Finished with a rhubarb and custard desert and washed down with a lovely Spanish white. Once landed bags were quick out on the belt and away we went. So well down BA for what I know for others turned out to be a nightmare.
1480,Jordan Charles (Argentina) 12th May 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-EZE business class on board B777. Tired old cabin old IFE system. Business class seat layout cramped and uncomfortable with forward and rear facing seats. However cabin crew deserve praise for their excellent attention.
1481,Clive V Drake (United Kingdom) 11th May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Pisa-LGW. Lounge at Pisa is a shared set up and rather nice. Spacious and colourful. Comfortable seats. Much better than hanging around the terminal. We have used it a few times. Plenty of booze. Mediocre snacks. No food. Checked in online. Baggage drop off. No problems. Plane was parked on the tarmac. Had to hike across in hot sun (which made me wish I wasn't going home). This is very annoying - because the whole point over flying BA instead of the three bright white blue and yellow planes of the Irish airline's planes parked next door - is convenience. This has in the past but did not this time include the use of an air-bridge. (More BA cuts I wonder) Plane was a newish A319 - and pushed back to the minute - and left bang on time. All clean and tidy including the wash-rooms. Seats rather old and worn - but we were comfortable in seats 1 a and 1 c. Afternoon tea served on board - nothing exceptional (not a lot one can do with this sort of meal) - but as my wife was driving when we landed I happily drank three Gin and T's. FA's very pleasant and friendly. Even offered me a 4th G&T which I declined. All in all a good experience. (seats could be much better though). Landed ahead of schedule.
1482,Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 11th May 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,I flew from Heathrow to Istanbul on BA on their 767 the crew in Club Europe were very accommodating in their service. From start to finish of the flight they ensured that all passengers in Club Europe received the upmost service. Although the 767 is starting to show some age I prefer this version of the Club Europe seats compared to the new configuration which is being rolled out on their Airbuses. At least the seats on the 767 are comfortable & there is plenty of space between the rows compared the the new version which has the same pitch as economy. The catering was good with a great choice of meals to select from the service was speedy and accommodating too with their drinks etc..
1483,N Goodwin (United Kingdom) 11th May 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew First from London to Seattle checked in at T5 and escorted to check-in desk and was checked in very quickly security was quick and then through the million dollar door straight into the Concorde Room. Had lunch in the lounge and think our host was just finishing her shift as not that attentive and service improved markedly when other staff took over after our starters. Good selection of food and drinks and a very relaxing start to our flight. Boarding smooth and both of us were escorted to our seats 2E/F which are 2 together in the middle of the cabin. Cabin crew on both sides were excellent and couldn't do enough to make our flight comfortable. Seat very good and food good quality with a wide selection of drinks available. Flight passed very quickly and being first off plane meant we were first at US immigration although there was no queues so through within 5 minutes and our bags were first off. Excellent flight.
1484,Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 11th May 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA 677 Istanbul to London Heathrow Club Europe a great flight with a wonderful crew in Club Europe excellent service from all members of the crew with updates and a warm welcome by name from them. The meal was very good indeed with a great choice of meals to choose from. Throughout the flight the crew were very professional and quick to serve the meal and to clear away the meal items too. Although a 767 which was showing some signs of age I much prefer this aircraft with the old style Club Europe seats compared to the new Club Europe which has been rolled out by BA and which no one likes. A wonderful flight and great service what more could I ask from a great crew all that I do ask is keep the 767 & go back to the old Club Europe.
1485,Rene van Mierlo (United Kingdom) 10th May 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Manchester to JFK via Heathrow and back. Positive experience although the flight from Manchester to Heathrow was delayed (outside BA control) we were constantly informed about the delays. Attention to detail was excellent. BA upgraded our flights at our request promptly and without any fuss (Silver wedding Anniversary). The flight attendants were excellent and the food (and drinks) was tasty. Some passengers can be somewhat critical about BA but we were more then satisfied with the service.
1486,Richard Taylor (United Kingdom) 10th May 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled from Gatwick to Barbados on Boeing 777. Seating very good. As many reviewers mention the screen is small with a limited amount of films. Overall staff very good although one member of staff forget to give bread rolls out with the dinner until asked. The same member of staff also forgot requested drinks. Very good boarding procedure and disembarkment Overall a pleasant flight.
1487,A Khasawneh (United Arab Emirates) 8th May 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,IST-LHR the so called business class is a joke and is virtually indistinguishable from economy on any decent airline seats are crammed together and do not recline properly there is no sort of entertainment whatsoever on a four hour flight. Having flown on Turkish Royal Jordanian Emirates and Cathay Pacific in the past couple of months only made the contrast more striking. Never again!
1488,John Murray (United Kingdom) 8th May 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,A short hop from LCY-ZRH. Nice clean Embraer which was only about 30% full on a Monday afternoon. Off on time landed early decent pasta salad meal and a white wine in flight. Smooth and efficient journey at a very good price.
1489,J K Suykerbuyk (Belgium) 8th May 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,SAT-DFW-LHR-BRU: First First club Europe. SAT-DFW: Nice and smooth check-in with friendly ground crew no lounge but used my priority pass to enter United lounge. Plane delayed for one hour. Boarding smooth greeted by friendly cabin crew captain apologised for the delay. Offered hot towels and champagne and crisps or nuts. Short but nice flight. Landed with a small delay. DFW-LHR: First class lounge in DFW is very basic and far from boarding gate. Boarding again was very smooth with waiting flight crew greeting you by name and guiding to your seat. Champagne was offered before you could take place in your seat. This first class travel was again a more than excellent flight. Also this time there was a technical issue but the captain informed us about every step excused several times for the delay again when landing in London with a delay of more than an hour. Cabin crew gives you the feeling you are the only guest on board giving you private service on demand. LHR-BRU: Club Europe. Concorde room with online reserved Cabana and a tasteful breakfast. Private bathroom with shower gave me a new revival boost. Boarding yes again excellent in all ways short flight. Hot towels decent food and perfect service by a perfect crew.
1490,J Rodder (United Kingdom) 30th April 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Heathrow to Bilbao. This is one of BA's new routes (although they used to fly the route years ago on a B757) and we got our return flights for a bargain Â£74. BA's hand luggage only fares to Europe offer very good value and I wonder when they will consider this pricing tier for long haul routes! The A319 flight left from Heathrow Terminal 1 which is closing in June but now looks and feels like a ghost town. There were 3 shops open on the day of our departure and most of it is boarded up. As for the flight we had the usual BA chaotic boarding process but overall an excellent flight even if the new seats are uncomfortable and certainly similar to Ryanair with hardly any space. I appreciate BA's offering of sandwiches on their short haul flights but do wonder whether passengers really need this service nowadays.
1491,R Mehta (United Kingdom) 30th April 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,NCL-LHR return. Great alternative to rail travel which is sometimes more expensive. Check-in was a breeze on both sides. New comfortable A320 cabin old ones were really aged. A choice of snack and drink were served with options for alcohol. Delay arriving into Heathrow as usual the airport is really over capacity and limiting BA as an airline. Annoyed that you are no longer able to choose your seat on hand-baggage only fares!
1492,W Roberts (United Kingdom) 30th April 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from London Heathrow to Rome Fiumicino. Flew the same route last year too and both times it was excellent. This time our flight was operated with an Airbus A320 with slim line seats that looked brand new. These were very comfortable for a short haul flight and the leg room sufficient. In-flight catering was excellent. Coffee was a bit weak but the sandwiches were delicious. This time cheese and ham doorstop with white bread. I expected good things after last years flat bread and was not disappointed. Cabin crew were very friendly and efficient as were the airport staff. Boarding process was fast and efficient and on both flights at arrival and destination the aircraft was at a jet bridge so no need to board a bus. Flights departed and arrived on time. Will definitely fly BA again.
1493,Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 26th April 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,Club Europe LHR-AMS. The boarding process was a joke we had to take the bus to our aircraft. In the boarding lounge they asked for all Club Europe and Gold and Silver to come forward and board the bus then they let all of the remaining passengers board the bus which made priority boarding a total joke. They should follow the same process when flights land at a remote stand and have a separate bus just for use by Club Europe passengers at least when departing Club Europe passengers would enjoy their priority boarding. I understand there is a need for on time departures but BA really need to ensure that where priority boarding is taking place their Club Passenger receive it.
1494,Stephen Mordey (United Kingdom) 24th April 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"BA 1321 Newcastle to Heathrow 1/4/15. Check in at Newcastle was as always very fast and efficient. Once on board the cabin crew did a great job of welcoming everyone. A great crew offering old school BA charm at it's best and no small achievement considering the very early departure time. New and very ""compact"" seating which seems to be the new norm for economy class travel on short haul European flights. Flight arrived at T5 not quite on time as I remember but hey ho not at all bad."
1495,Smith Christine (United Kingdom) 24th April 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Flew Gatwick to Kingston 13/3/15 return 27/3/15 big disappointment had to climb over strangers legs to leave seats. Not all options of food available if your at the end of the meal run. Need to pay to sit together separated from my husband who was next to a nice bloke who was happy to move so we could sit together BA did not even try to accommodate us. Not worth the money Virgin far superior from their lounge to the flight. Will never travel BA long haul again be warned don't waste your money.
1496,Stephen Mordey (United Kingdom) 24th April 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,BA1326 Heathrow to Newcastle 22/4/15. Checked in at T5 by an agent who should train some of the others. Very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. The good experience ended there. Punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule! Well marvellous not in my opinion. Having just flown around the world on another airline which was able to operate twelve out of thirteen flights either on time or ahead of schedule I have to say that I remain generally unimpressed.
1497,Gary O'Neill (United Kingdom) 24th April 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Hong Kong to London in World. It was on the A380 - first time aboard and must say I was impressed. A much better experience than the Emirates A380. Great mood lighting large windows. Nice to have a number of small cabins on both decks. Friendly service from the crew.
1498,G Alexander (Australia) 23rd April 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,April 3 2015 Sydney-LHR. Staff were quite attentive and pleasant throughout both sectors. The cabin looked very new was clean and comfortable. IFE was fine although not as good as CX. I was sitting in window seat facing backwards which was fine. The seat while sitting is comfortable enough although quite narrow. There is little storage and it can be awkward getting in and out of the seat especially when you are on the window. The problem was when the seat was in flat-bed mode. It is so narrow that you cannot turn. The seat buckles in the middle. As well the passenger next to me would slam his table and TV monitor shut throughout the flight and because of the design the seat you feel every movement. To get comfortable I had to put the seat in more of a recline mode in order to sleep which defeats the whole purpose of a flat bed. As well a fold down footstool completes the end of the bed and it wasn't stable. BA are charging a premium for this seat and they squeeze 8 across (compared to 4 for CX). They are making a great deal out of this amount of real estate in the air. It is time for them to deliver an update. The only reason I took this fare was because of the great luggage offering (which I needed on this occasion - 96 kg) and the fact that I was flying back in First for no additional cost which I will post about separately. So while I recommend this airline overall it is more because the service and staff did compensate. Next time I fly business it will be CX again. The seat is a real let down.
1499,Telli Ali (Turkey) 23rd April 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,15th Aug 2014 flight BA0272. Me and my 3 friends flew from SAN to LHR then to IST. Our check in and baggage processes took almost 2 hours to be completed. I wonder what would happen if we were not been there 5 hours before our flight. When they gave us our tickets we saw that they put us all separately. They could not even manage to sit us together. When I was thinking how could this get worse we missed our LHR-IST flight and waited in a queue for 3 hours to go to our hotel. While a clerk was trying to complete our check-in for 2 hours another clerk next to her managed to complete half of the passengers processes and when we were boarding the plane we learnt that the plane was overbooked and the other cl erk was offering 800 dollars per person and free accommodation for volunteer passengers to fly on the next plane.
1500,K Jona (United Kingdom) 19th April 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,My experience on return BA flights to LHR to Tokyo Narita in April 2015 scores very low. I used to fly on Virgin Atlantic for the same journey on Business Class for the past 10 years so I have something to compare and the fare is always more or less the same between those 2 airlines. Conclusion is that you get far better value and service for money for the Business Class on Virgin was my impression. BA T5 lounge is very photogenic but the reality is quite 'basic' and cheap decor. Selection of food and beverages is limited. In the end I got fed up so I left the lounge to get better food from Wetherspoons! Since I'm small both airlines seats are fine to get a good sleep. On BA you'd still have to pay to select your seat despite paying thousands of pounds! Also if you are in the middle aisle on BA you are right next to a stranger which is awkward. BA gives out Elemis kits. Food: on BA there is a 'fixed' options. For the dessert you have to choose either 'cake' or 'cheese'. Not both. Also not too different a menu from Economy class. BA's service felt extremely limited they don't know your names they just do the very minimum service. BA disappointed me.
1501,R Vines (United Kingdom) 19th April 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,My return flight from Heathrow to Bologna last week reminded me of how good BA is for short haul in economy. Even a two-hour delay because of technical problems on the outgoing flight did nothing to change that view. The pilot kept us up to date on what was happening. The crew were charming. OK the snack of a sandwich on such flights is pretty basic but the whole experience is so much more civilized than on budget airlines.
1502,H Stewart (United Kingdom) 19th April 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Gatwick to Thessaloniki return. Outbound ok not fantastic but certainly not bad. However where BA scored was on the return. At check-in the clerk was all prepared for my wife and I even though we were on separate bookings including ready printed lounge passes with my guest pass stapled to her own. Maybe a little thing but it made a difference.
1503,A Gurevich (United States) 17th April 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,"10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it."
1504,J McDonald (United Kingdom) 17th April 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BA256 from Delhi to Heathrow - usual BA issues which have been repeated here many times. Firstly the First cabin was not clean (at all) with debris on the floor food still in the seat - it's pretty pathetic when you have to spend 5 minutes cleaning your area when you board! The food - the food can only be described as truly awful! To be honest I would be complaining if I received this standard of food in economy - the starter was a watery oily leek and potato soup and for the main two small lamb chops overdone in gravy with 6 tiny potatoes that deflated when pierced with a fork. I did not bother with desert! Afternoon tea served up (probably) the worst patisserie I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - completely inedible. The cabin crew were good and pleasant however I was not offered any bottled water for a 10 hour flight. It would seem to me that BA are a budget airline trying to do luxury and failing horribly. Surely management cannot be happy with their current standards but I am struggling to see any level of improvement (I take at least 1 first class international flight every year). Have flown BA for 15 years will now be trying other airlines. The lounge (not run by BA but used by BA) at Delhi was very good indeed.
1505,A Gurevich (United States) 17th April 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,9 April 2015 BA 777 Business Class Seattle USA - Heathrow. Check-in easy lounge good boarding pleasant. Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
1506,G Scholes (United Kingdom) 17th April 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,DEL-LHR BA 256. Seats 17AB downstairs in business class in B747-400 G-BNLY. The aircraft is an old lady now but the interior is well maintained. Her age was most noticeable looking at the in-flight screen. I have become used to the clarity of modern screens and the faded dim and blurred old fashioned moving map and flight information screens are a relic of a distant past. I have made several long haul flights with BA in Business Class recently and have decided that I don't like the standard BA model business class seat. There is nowhere to put small items like glasses pens landing cards and so on. There is a drawer at floor level suitable for shoes and other items you will not want during the flight but to access it you need an upright seat and have to sit well forward to lean down to it. There is no foot rest integrated into the seat one you can adjust to your own preferred level. At the front of the seat pod is a flap then can be lowered by getting out of the seat. It is not strong and so can not be used as a seat and is not an ottoman. Clunky and peculiar to BA it is not a design feature that enhances the seat. Individual seats feel narrow and the window seat pod facing aft is accessed through a narrow entrance leading into a snug and very private space. Thoughts about coffins come to mind. When the passenger in the row behind has their seat flat their feet cross the entrance to yours and have to be stepped over to exit. Seat 17B was a poor choice. It is just aft of a set of catering cupboards that are frequently accessed during meal service and a washroom that seems to be in use almost continuously with queues stretching past the seat after meals and before landing. On the good side the seats are well contoured and comfortably padded.
1507,Lynn Ryder (United Kingdom) 16th April 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,We flew for the very first time on BA on 27/03/15 and returned 06/03/15. Our holiday to St Lucia from Gatwick was booked through Kuoni and we usually fly with Virgin Atlantic. We always upgrade with Virgin to Premium Economy as you have a larger luggage allowance and the Premium Economy Experience with Virgin is very good. Therefore we booked BA World Traveller Plus expecting the same degree of service. What a disappointment! I would not advise wasting your upgrade money. Apart from getting the larger luggage allowance BA World Traveller Plus is almost exactly the same as World Traveller. The Service both ways was appalling! The seats were old and shabby and uncomfortable we were only offered bar service once on a 8/9 Hour flight! We had to drink from plastic beakers the staff seemed preoccupied with Business Class Customers and had no time for our section at all. On the way back my Husband and myself were given seats 2 rows apart at check in without being told. We only noticed when we boarded the aircraft. On this length of flight I was most upset we were apart as everyone sat near me were single travellers and Were asleep throughout the 9 hours. The seat back TVs are very small and my TV didn't work properly and I couldn't even watch anything. The aircraft was badly in need of an interior upgrade. We will never fly with BA again anywhere and will not recommend the experience to anyone.
1508,H Geyer (United Kingdom) 16th April 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Substandard food in Business Class (London to Mauritius) arbitrary upgrade policy - as we could not afford Bus Class on return flight booked Premium Economy we told that because we were Bus on way out we would get priority consideration on way back. Charging for Seat selection is a rip off was separated from my wife on way out!
1509,J Rose (Australia) 14th April 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,BA 208 MIA-LHR in Club. Leg four of a seven leg BA adventure. Another disappointment which is becoming commonplace. As in leg one BKK-LHR my pre-assigned business class seat that I had selected months before departure mysteriously vanished at the gate. In the end BA needed the seat for a family to be seated together. All well and good mind you but to have the audacity to charge passengers for these seats and give them away is absolutely disgraceful. As such my quiet no traffic window seat on the upper deck was quickly relegated to a high traffic aisle seat on the main deck right near the lavatory and galley ensuring no sleep on the overnight flight. As a loyal OneWorld Emerald passenger I can honestly say BA really don't care about us in this (or any) regard. The CSD was sympathetic and kind but nobody else seemed to care one bit. That hasn't happened to me on any other carrier for years and has happened twice in the past few weeks on BA. Moral of the story: Never ever pay BA for a pre-assigned seat as there is simply no guarantee you will get what you pay for. Moral of the story part 2: fly another carrier if you can as it can't be much worse than BA.
1510,P Michaels (United Kingdom) 10th April 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-JFK/IAD-LHR. Superb round trip (for a very fair price) in economy with BA. Flight out was an hour or so late taking off because of the weather but was excellent once we got going. Fairly creaky 747 but the IFE was fine (good film selection) and the free booze flowed throughout. Great curry on the food front. Return was the real highlight on a new A380 that had joined the fleet four weeks ago. Large TVs even bigger selection of films/TV shows/games and the usual good free food (shepherd's pie) and drink (red wine and beer). Comfy seats with plenty of leg room (and I'm over six foot). Service on both flights exemplary and I have to say that I think BA have become a really class act.
1511,A Bouzid (United Kingdom) 10th April 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew 30th March 2015 LHR-YVR return with my school on a rugby tour (27 people). Seats were reasonably comfortable and they catered to my food requests of no pork well. Enjoyed it. But the IFE was absolutely horrendous and did not meet my expectations of British Airways- outdated movies with TV shows from 3 months before. Since we were flying on a Boeing 747-400 there were more seats per aisle but this made the cabin feel quite cramped. One recommendation for them - put fewer seats per aisle! Even though there were negatives flying outbound I have to say the return was great. I had swapped seats with another boy who wanted to sit next to someone so I sat in the extra legroom seats. IFE was far better and due to having the window seat I was able to sleep for around 6 hours when I was awoke by the breakfast/snack which was decent. Food had no flavour and was quite spicy (Lentil masala) but still edible. Although my experience on BA84 was very enjoyable I heard many of my companions had to move seats because of the not working IFE. One of my coaches had ordered orange juice so the cabin crew gave it to him as they were serving but then the other one would take it away for some reason and in the end they said they had none left. He had flown with Cathay Pacific to Manila the preceding week and he said that he had enjoyed that thoroughly. One of his worst experiences of air travel especially due to him being 6'4 and rather large. Overall a decent experience but just met my expectations. To improve British Airways need to start to be able to compete with other airlines like Singapore Emirates Etihad Cathay Pacific and Qantas as there service and level of comfort has definitely taken over from BA.
1512,Russell David (United Kingdom) 10th April 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Heathrow to Istanbul flight BA0676 in club class. I should have guessed what I was going to get when I saw this service is operated on a Boeing 767. Business or club class is a total waste of money same seat as in economy. No extra leg room or width no individual inflight entertainment and no seat power it's horrendous you may just as well book euro traveller. Both seats had seen better days the covers of which were in places falling apart. Food was only average too in my opinion. On the plus side of things the plane was for its age (it was the oldest 767 BA has got) in surprisingly good order and the staff were friendly enough and the flight arrived only ten minutes late which is a result.
1513,Fang Jun (China) 8th April 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,From Shanghai to London on 17 Mar. The whole trip was very good. The check in procedure was very quick. Boarding was finished very quickly. The cabin staff were helpful and friendly. The cabin was very quiet. The temperature was very appropriate. I did enjoy the flight. Meal was tasty drinks were quite good .Luggage was not lost. I really can not expect more.
1514,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 8th April 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,Flew Warsaw to Heathrow. Reasonable all round. Fairly nice sandwich and drinks. Crew were patient with some passengers who thought they were in an all inclusive hotel. Very busy flight. New seats are extremely cramped. Feels a bit Ryanair. Boarding a bit chaotic as didn't do by seat row. Baggage started coming off one carousel at Heathrow only to inexplicably move to a different one without warning or announcement.
1515,S Stevenson 8th April 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,I travelled from London to Jo'burg and back on the Airbus 380 and had mixed experiences. On the way out I was in Premium Economy and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious seat and window locker and slept well. The return in Business was a different matter. I was truly shocked by how many seats had been crammed in the uncomfortable narrow seat the lack of privacy and having to climb over passenger's feet to vacate my seat. All this at a premium price. Shocking. The cabin crew were faultless and were only too aware of passengers' views on the cabin! Never again.
1516,M Coyle (Ireland) 6th April 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,Return LHR-YVR Boeing 747-400. I had been advised to fly BA but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed with the return leg. My seat was double booked so they eventually got me one but the entertainment system was not working! When I asked about it she said it had not been working yesterday either. No other vacant seats in economy but there were loads in business class but would not upgrade me. 10hr flight with nothing. Definitely would not fly with them again.
1517,Egli Nicolaidou (United Kingdom) 6th April 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,I usually have very positive experiences when flying BA. This time travelling on 30/03/15 LCA-LGW the staff could not have been any less interested in the comfort of the passengers. It was a 4.5 hour flight and were served the meal within the first 20minutes with nothing to do for the next 4 hours. There was no inflight entertainment. The staff did not offer any hot drinks and when I walked all the way to the end of the aircraft to ask about a hot drink was told no one was going round offering tea but if I wanted one I could go and get it from service area. The staff couldn't have looked any more disinterested in their passengers!
1518,R Simon (Austria) 6th April 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-JER-LGW day trip on March 25 both flights in Economy morning flight on Airbus 319 evening flight back on a 737-400 still featuring the more comfortable old seats. Both flights on-time or early. Excellent service for this short domestic hop. A breakfast sandwich and drinks were served in the morning while crisps or biscuits and full bar service were offered on the evening flight back. FAs were excellent on both legs providing a good efficient and friendly service on these short flights. Flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for both legs which worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable which is good. BAs Terraces Lounge in LGW is fairly comfortable and spacious enough although very busy in the morning. Acceptable cold breakfast choices and porridge as the only hot alternative. Drink choices were plentiful and of good quality. BAs Terraces Lounge in JER was more basic but again comfortable. Again various good quality drink alternatives but just very limited food options (basic snacks such as crisps and hot soup). Overall an excellent domestic flight experience for Economy. Would be more than happy to do it again. (Oneworld Sapphire).
1519,Lilliam Washburn (United States) 6th April 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Booked a trip via American Airlines and my flight from London to Seattle was on BA. What a treat. I wish all my AA trips were done by BA. Great service leg space beautiful gates airplanes. The 8.5 hr trip went by quickly. TV in every seat with plenty of great choices. Food was good and flight attendants were helpful and patient.
1520,K Rahman (India) 26th March 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,DEL-LHR-HAM in Business. The club world product feels really old now. The seats are narrow and not up to the standards of a world class airline. It was innovative when it came out but now feels narrow dated and not a match even to Air India which has modern flat seats on the Dreamliner. The food was OK but nothing special. The service was also ok but lacked touches like smiles hot towels. Amenity kits very cheap. The young Indian crew members on the Delhi route noticeably better than the older London based British crew. The plane was an old and slightly grubby 747. Basically everything was mediocre if adequate. The overall impression was a product past it's prime from the 1990s. Old planes old crew old seats old IFE BA are losing ground not just to Emirates but also other European carriers like LH or AF. It feels like the 1970s and 1980s before BA transformed itself.
1521,G O'Neill (United Kingdom) 26th March 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Day to trip to Hamburg booked the day before travel. Great value for money. Outbound flight was on refurbished A320. Great new cabin comfortable seats - with enough legroom and great new lighting. On return was another A320 class - not refurbished. Definitely will be good once all are refitted.
1522,C Goldhill (United Kingdom) 26th March 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,I flew today from San Francisco to Heathrow Business Class and as always it's a delight flying with BA. Staff were helpful and polite - in fact they couldn't do enough for me. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment was OK and food was satisfactory. My only criticism is that on the outbound flight we were served lunch immediately on taking off but then had to wait neatly 7 hours for a light snack before landing. As I did not want to 'raid the larder' and eat fattening foods I was left starving! I still find the overall experience with BA is far superior to any other airline.
1523,G Sainty (United Kingdom) 25th March 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"I have been a longstanding BA gold card holder and frequent business traveller. BA has now replaced all business class seats on short haul flights with seats so cramped that at 6'4"" I could not sit without great discomfort. This shows complete contempt for BA's customers. I first encountered this on a round trip to Brussels. It will be Eurostar for me in the future and Air France for which I also gave a gold card on other short hauls. Is the management so confident of its customer base that it can give us less space than Easyjet offers?"
1524,R Beech (United Kingdom) 25th March 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-LAX - A380 was excellent a breath of fresh air in comparison to the typical tired planes of BA. Mixed fleet crew very friendly and enthusiastic. Food onboard was excellent received my first choice and the club kitchen was stocked with a selection of delicious sweet and savoury snacks. The upper deck was excellent as it was very quiet and private with approx 20 seats in the forward section. Entertainment very good on a larger screen than found on 747/777. Cabin very clean and in general felt very fresh and new. The only gripe is still having to climb over the passenger seated in the aisle with the ying yang layout.
1525,K Kirby (United Kingdom) 25th March 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,We flew from LHR to Brussels and back on a reward flight which was very pleasant even though it was a quick hop across the channel! Just about had time to enjoy the cream tea on the outbound flight. Quality of the tea drink was the best I've tasted in the sky. The champagne was very nice too. Business lounge at Brussels was very pleasant and is to be recommended.
1526,Clare Alan (United Kingdom) 25th March 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,GRU-LHR 15 March 2015. Returned to BA this last 3 flights solely due to Avios companion coupon but purchased this tkt. Bossy cabin crew in the like of BA as we remember its glory days. G&T always welcome but skimpy and only one and no nibbles! Wine was good this flight. South America routes still dogged with ageing 747 as opposed to Lufthansa's modern or upgraded fleet. Outbound from LHR my TV didn't work but they did credit me 3000 avios. Food okay but snacks for such a long flight poor. KLM and AF do it better.
1527,C Watson (Switzerland) 25th March 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,GVA-LGW-GVA A319 out and A320 in. On time in both directions staff were professional and polite. Sandwich out and a choice of snacks (crisps biscuits or chocolate raisins) in as well as complementary drinks including alcohol. Smooth through Geneva airport in and out; stuck in a 40-minute passport queue at LGW on the way in (not BA's fault of course) followed by a long walk around renovation work for the airport shuttle to the train station. This was a rare occasion where BA was cheaper than all of the competition on the route. On balance I just don't think the BA experience is much better than the low-cost competition unless you fly to Heathrow where Terminal 5 is much nicer than Gatwick. Although the food and drink is free the choice is quite limited (e.g. no British beer no option to buy something substantial if you're hungry and the snack was a bit stingy on the way back). I thought we might get newspapers but we didn't. On balance it was perfectly fine but I wouldn't pay the extra for BA - I'd actually rather have the choice friendliness and flexibility you get with easyJet.
1528,Sharma Anita (India) 23rd March 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,"Having heard so many negative reviews of BA I still mustered the courage to book to trip to Chicago and SFO. To begin with when I reached Mumbai airport with our online check in printouts 4 hours before scheduled departure I was pleasantly surprised to see the BA staff ready to check in the baggage. We were thru checked in up to Chicago with a 5 hour halt at LHR. London Heathrow Terminal 5 is chaotic to say the least the security taking forever (in our case 45 min) to clear the hand baggage gave us some 3 hours before we boarded our Chicago flight which was comfortable. Our next connection from Chicago to SFO on AA was a bit messy as the cabin space was full and last minute check-in of hand baggage was enforced. Then for our SFO-LHR-DEL flight the SFO-LHR got delayed but again check-in was pleasant and though the connection time between two flights was 80 minutes because of the delay we had a margin of only 35 minutes. When we requested the flight purser to let us disembark before anyone else he said ""why did you take this connection even if you make it somehow your baggage wont"" - so much for assistance! Even after disembarking last of all we were met by the BA representative at the gate who took us thru the fast track channel and we made it to the flight in a record 20 minutes. All went well except for one tiny hitch one piece of baggage never made it to our next flight."
1529,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 20th March 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Flew to and from Punta Cana from Gatwick. Two good flights. Orderly check-in. Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato frankly don't bother. Flights pretty much on time. Both very busy. Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA as the seats and catering are not up to much. Check in was excellent at both ends. There was a minor system glitch at Punta Cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. Top notch.
1530,R Tomkins (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,First time in reduced leg room Club Europe. Don't bother no different to economy both colleague and I sat with legs splayed jammed into seat in front. Save your money fly in the back and spend considerable savings on a better hotel better holiday or whatever. Good crew and food though.
1531,C Cutts (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-SOF-LHR seat 1A on an upgraded A320 in both directions check in at T5 quick and the galleries lounge was fine as always. Departed on time a breakfast served by a pretty nice crew not that much room really for business class appears to be getting less. Return check in quick although security at Sofia very slow and the lounge is not worth using!! flight delayed around an hour due to weather but once away a decent meal served by yet another nice crew landed around 30 min late on a remote stand but bags on the belt by the time I reached it.
1532,I Gowon (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"This is not reflective of BA in general only this particular flight. I flew LHR-ABV on Saturday 7th March. This was the Friday 6th flight that had to be rescheduled due to technical issues. Now if anyone is familiar with this route you will know that service onboard is sometimes not as consistent as say the transatlantic routes. Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food would have been good save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine Chicken and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows. Anyway I opted for the chicken. I must say I was supremely underwhelmed. It was nothing short of a ""school dinner"": flavourless and unappetising."
1533,Panos Anastasopoulos (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,BA085 LHR to YVR 10/03/15. Narrow seats without much legroom food acceptable but nothing special. Upgrade not an option due to restrictions of avios programme. Overall not happy.
1534,Angie Kirkpatrick (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,London to Budapest and back in Club class. First leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. Usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. The return was terrible. BA do not pay for Cub Europe travellers to use Fast Track at security - disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. The lounge is mediocre at best. Absolutely not worth paying for Club. BA need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.
1535,Clive V Drake (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-PISA-LHR. I have a house in Tuscany so fly there often. I used to fly a certain yellow/blue/white budget carrier from Stansted but got fed up at being treated like an inconvenience and that the FA's consistently spoke poor English. As a Silver card holder my wife and I enjoyed a nice breakfast in the lounge. It was not busy. We were seated in the exit rows which I selected before we left. It was better than the Club Europe space I had last month - which is why I bought economy as opposed to Club which I feel represents very poor value. The plane was a nice new A320 with the new seats. It was spotless. We had a nice snack on both flights + a few Gin and Tonics for me ! (the wife was driving on arrival) The FAs were great. Friendly and treated us like customers - not like cattle. Funnily enough both flights pushed back early and arrived early. Flight home was a bit rough due to high winds around Pisa - and a re-assuring comment over the PA system was a thoughtful touch to nervous flyers - my wife included. All in all BA at its best. They either getting it right or spectacularly wrong. There never appears to be anything in the middle. Am flying again with them in 4 weeks time and look forward to it.
1536,A Crow (United Kingdom) 17th March 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,Flew to Bangkok with Thai Airways who were lovely to fly with great choice of food and good leg room. We were expecting at least the same level of comfort and service with BA. The leg room is terrible and only an hour after take off the lady in front put her chair in full recline and made the space in front of me so claustrophobic I couldn't see the TV screen as it was so close to my face as well as having to sit at an awkward position as I have long legs and couldn't put them out in front of me. So uncomfortable. The food was dire with cheap pasta or minuscule fish with more rice After a fortnight of eating rice it would have been nice to have something different. Does BA actually read and take notice of these negative reviews are we wasting our time?
1537,Desmond Whelan (Ireland) 9th March 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I travel world-wide mostly on business and in Business Class. I don't think I have ever had a flight with BA that wasn't without an issue. Recently and not for the first time I checked in to find that Club Class had been over sold. So lets call it what it is.. Greed it's a disgusting practice. The planes are usually dirty and if you get ""Bumped"" down to Economy the food is awful while the Cabin crew are mostly helpful and friendly you don't see them apart from meal time even when you use the call button where do they go and what and what are they doing?"
1538,Richard Lightbody (United Kingdom) 9th March 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,I flew from LHR to SIN; the aircraft was a Boeing 747-400 which was tired and old. The IFE had to be re-booted and the system was not yet up to date like on other BA aircraft. The seating cover on my Club World seat kept coming off the aircraft seemed very tired. The food again was at a good standard and the crew were helpful. I always fly BA and I love the Boeing 747 but unfortunately the 747 have to go at some point.
1539,C Cutts (United Kingdom) 9th March 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-SOF-LHR 27th Feb/2nd Mar Seat A1 on an A320 in both directions check in at T5 quick used the BA Galleries South lounge which was good as ever. Boarding on time as was departure and arrival new business seats on both aircraft which were comfortable enough. Food (Breakfast) and crew on outbound very good bags waiting once through immigration in Sofia. Return check in quick although security check was so slow the lounge in Sofia is dreadfully dull with no facilities food or drinks passengers would be better of using the general airport facilities! Departure was almost an hour late as was arrival due to weather at Heathrow; otherwise crew were great as was the lunch served.
1540,B Starkey (United Kingdom) 24th February 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BA2043 Gatwick to Male in World Traveller Plus. Plane a Boeing 777 which was very old and thus the entertainment screen was small. The main dissatisfaction was the food - going out it was the worst that we had ever had in long haul and coming back it was not much better. The choices ran out when the cabin crew got to me (comment someone has to be last and unfortunately it is you sir). I finally got my choice when the Captain gave up his first choice! Other airlines particularly middle east and far east based do a much better job.
1541,N Ingram (United Kingdom) 24th February 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Returning from St Vincent late on LIAT Airways we landed in Barbados at 1750 for the 1755 flight to Gatwick. The BA and Virgin flights to Gatwick were still on the Tarmac. All Virgin passengers were quickly met by a representative and sent through to the flight. BA customers had to fend for themselves and therefore missed the flight. That meant pleading for a seat on the 21.10 hrs flight. Not good customer relations. I should add the supervisor at check in was brilliant though.
1542,Ian Sinclair (United Kingdom) 24th February 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-AMS on Friday 13th. Flight delayed by almost an hour despite being informed in the lounge that everything was on time reason provided by Captain was late inbound aircraft. (this was my third late running BA flight in as many weeks). No apologies other than the rather matter of fact explanation from the flight deck surly cabin crew who clearly wanted to be somewhere else other than looking after their guests on board. I have two more flights in the coming month with BA rather regretting having booked with this carrier now.
1543,A Cogan (Ireland) 24th February 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,Beyond Appalling. Flight delayed by ten minutes departing Rome to LHR. As a result one passenger decided he was going to miss his connection in LHR. He was allowed disembark thus leading to a delay in departure from Rome of over 1 hour 30 minutes. Consequent late arrival to LHR. Missed connecting flight. Abandoned in Heathrow at 10.30 on a Sunday night had to book new flights miss a day work find a hotel for the night. Ground staff of no use whatsoever. Staff totally unhelpful. Taking things to a logical conclusion what was to stop more passengers disembarking before departure thus delaying the flight ad infinitum. Correspondence/ contact with BA has been a joke since.
1544,Louise Robinson (United Kingdom) 24th February 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I have always travelled BA and have recently been upgraded to bronze which I would have thought had a few perks? Wrong! My 15 year old son and I travelled from LHR-NYC on BA but it was a code-share with American Airlines. I couldn't check in online so we stood in the long queue and couldn't book an aisle seat either. BA at the airport apparently couldn't help because it was a code-share even though I had bought through BA! The flight was on time and seats a reasonable size. Coming back we flew from Washington Dulles airport - there was a snow storm and it was freezing. The plane which was an Airbus 380 was supposed to leave at 6.35pm and showing departing ""on time"" not until 6.15 pm on the 21st Feb. Then BA Announced a 20 min delay which sounded reasonable considering the weather outside and all the other planes were delayed or cancelled! We were all boarded on the plane when they announced the plane was too heavy to be pushed out and there was too much snow behind the plane so they called the snow ploughs! We sat on the plane for 6 hours with no food or refreshments except water! There was nowhere for us go apparently so we couldn't get off the plane. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that with all the snow and a huge airplane that there would be large problems. The final straw was after 5 hrs and the third attempt to move the plane was that we had to sit for another 45 mins defrosting the wings! British Airways were not prepared to cancel or reschedule the flight but instead made us sit like cattle on the airplane. It's a disgrace and we they will probably put it down to bad weather and not negligence bad planning or bad management on their part! Time to look at a new airline to fly with."
1545,P Seligman (India) 24th February 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,I fly BA business regularly between Delhi and London. I was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg. Also why not get some decent magazines - Country life Decanter the Economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of Hello! I residually like BA but they have to up their game.
1546,Charles Berlin (United States) 18th February 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-JFK. End of a One-World RTW trip. What a disappointment. After a mind-numbing trip through Flight Connections (BA to BA) and a 15 minute walk to the last gate on the B concourse only to get on a 12-15 minute bus ride i was escorted to the F/C cabin which reminded me more of a rabbit warren than an airplane. The aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to put my carry-on bag in the overhead over my seat. Very claustrophobic. Seat was strange. Very narrow and difficult to sleep in - at least 6-7"" narrower than the seats on CX or AA. Strange recline mechanism - normally you can adjust the recline and the foot rest separately but not in here. The seat reclines in one motion so you can't ""fine tune"" it like with other airlines. Menu looked fantastic - apps were good salad was nothing special and the main course (Indian style Lamb) was virtually inedible. Cheeses were good desserts and wines OK. EVOD was not to the standards of the competition. Fewer movies and TV selections than either AA or CX. Crew was fine. Stick with AA/CX from now on."
1547,Ray Desjardins (United Kingdom) 18th February 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,Cabin crew polite unfortunately BA ran out of chicken ran out of wine ran out of soft drinks. The food was awful. Inflight service was a disaster - did not work properly. 12 hours 20 mins flight everything counts obviously BA overlooked this. To be fair all cabin crew were polite and accommodating. I will never fly again with BA.
1548,Gerry van de Linde (Australia) 18th February 2015,na,British Airways customer review,My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.
1549,M Thompson (United States) 18th February 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew F class on the A380 IAD-LHR-IAD. IAD lounge was charming great bar nice Concorde dining room with good service nice food and on my visit an excellent soup. Greeting staff very nice and bartenders that knew how to do their job. Only the slightest downfall was in the Club Class section of the lounge the finger sandwiches were dry as sand and just as flavorful. Station Manager Captain and Inflight Crew were was kind and generous with their time. Food was decent Champagne was great! IFS was strange and not easy to use but got help from FA's on both flights. Arrival at T5 was shocking. Like a heard of rabid bovine charging for the exits. Shoved like sardines into small trains with nothing to hold onto everyone started to tumble. Processing through fast track however was a breeze. Return. F check in is at the far end of the terminal agent at the counter had the personality of wall paper paste. Concorde Room staff were delightful breakfast was nice Massage was ok. Train to gate not nearly the terror it was on arrival. Boarding for First was a snap FA's top notch food ok. Arrival into IAD was as joyus as surgery with long walks confusing machines little help. Overall after reading so much negative about BA I was at least made to feel special at every stop except check in at T5.
1550,I Kroum (Germany) 11th February 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-LAX-LHR Economy. Both legs on lower deck of the A380 professional yet friendly service plenty of drink runs between meal services. Seat comfort superior to LH and AF380s. Travelled with an elderly passenger attentive gate staff allowed us to pre-board on both flights. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule. So far best transatlantic experience on an A380.
1551,G Guy (Australia) 11th February 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Sydney to Singapore return late Jan/early Feb 2015. The economy seats were relatively comfortable but could be a bit softer. The away leg (BA16) was quite good except for the meal which was barely edible. The flight back had a much improved meal but the entertainment system had repeated issues and had to be restarted about 4 times. Another problem with the return leg (BA15) is that if you get on the plane in Singapore and not in London by the time online check-in is open for you there are almost no seats to choose from. I wanted a window seat and had not a single window to choose from at the moment the online check-in opened for me. Service on both flights was good. I was feeling a bit dehydrated and asked for plenty of water on the return flight and had no problems at all. All the staff was nice and accommodating.
1552,Clive Drake (United Kingdom) 11th February 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-Zurich. The trip got off to a good start as the North lounge was not to busy and this made the whole experience relaxing rather than an endurance test - which it is when it is busy. Had a nice early light lunch. The aircraft was a new A321. I like this plane. It was rammed end to end. The plane had the new Club Europe seats and it reminded me how well BA seem to be in missing the opportunity to develop a product that could be really high in quality - but isn't. Unless you are seated in row ""1"" - the leg room is appalling and the same as economy. As with the old C.E. seat - the centre seat between 3 seats - is a table. Quite why this is logical escapes me - because it seems to imply that if it suits BA they will at a whim seat three passengers and not two. This was a grand opportunity to stand out from the competition and clearly establish a comfortable - wide C.E. seat. At the same time justify the higher pricing. Its no wonder BA have very few - if any - Travel Industry awards in the services they provide. So frustrating. I had another light lunch and a couple of Gin and Tonics which was nice. The FAs were great. Flight left a few minutes late but we whizzed over to Zurich in 80 minutes which was great. The World's favourite airline? Try ""The Worlds most frustrating airline!"""
1553,G Campbell (United Kingdom) 11th February 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,I flew club world from JHB to LHR on 21/01 on the 747. The flight experience overall was a good one. Sitting on the upper deck of 747 is definitely a must as its a fair bit quieter than the main deck. The check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk were very friendly especially considering I was travelling with loads of luggage bicycle etc. I didn't use the lounge as I know the one in JNB is not very good. The boarding took place on time and we were offered pre takeoff drinks soon after seating. Take off was a bit delayed but smooth non the less. The food leaves a lot to be desired on BA I had the Salmon main course which was very bland. The up side the champagne was perfectly chilled and the desert was yummy. The seat configuration is not the best as you are facing your neighbour. The seat in the lounging position is very comfy but is a bit narrow for sleeping it's also a bit short for taller individuals such as myself. Arrival at T5 was very smooth as I used the fast track lane from landing to climbing in the taxi was less than 30 min. I would definitely fly BA again but they do need to look into the quality of food and the seat configurations for future upgrades.
1554,V Pervaaz (United States) 11th February 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"I have been a loyal customer for the last 10 years and have progressively seen the service cleanliness and interest in client satisfaction decline. I just came back from a NYC-LHR-Dubai trip and will not fly BA again. Several reasons: my seat in Business Class was noticeably filthy - crumbs on the seat and hair on my pillow. When I told the attendant she just fluffed the pillow and walked away. I was hounded for not filling out the breakfast form in 5 minutes (the plane had not even taken off) and told that ""I would not get breakfast"". I was served raw chicken and when I expressed interest in another dish was told that all the other passengers had eaten and that there were no more dishes on the plane? The dish was taken away but no follow up or apologies - not even an extra bag of nuts to ensure that I was not hungry for the 7.5 hr flight. Perhaps the most disturbing part of traveling with BA is that the staff are unapologetically arrogant disinterested and unapproachable and any response is as if they are doing you a favor. As a customer paying nearly 10000 USD for a round trip ticket I shouldn't be afraid to speak to staff and highlight a dirty seat or food that is not cooked. The seats on two of the legs were broken and my screen did not work on three of the legs. There are plenty of other first class carriers out there that I will now become a customer of."
1555,M Gents (Netherlands) 11th February 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew AMS-LHR-JFK return 26th Dec - 31st Dec. AMS-LHR-AMS on A321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although I got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. How to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own tablet. So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.
1556,R Simpson (Australia) 6th February 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,My wife and I flew business class LHR-HKG 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 E&F. Check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was chatting with 2 friends. The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied This was very well cooked and presented the Thai green curry was excellent so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good I had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent I do think dessert and cheese should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. The IFE selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.
1557,J Clark (United Kingdom) 28th January 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR-MIA in WT+. Seats 13E and 13F on 747. It was very comfortable for a day flight and after a light meal I managed to get around 5 hours of sleep. Recline is good and leg room ok for a person of my height 5ft 10in. Food was ok and would have liked to eat my partners sticky toffee pudding because mine went down too well! We were off the plane first at MIA before First and club which was rather nifty. Good experience.
1558,Charles Green (United Kingdom) 28th January 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,Return flight from LHR T5 to Washington Dulles (IAD) in Club World. Check in was fine even if the layout of the T5 check-in area isn't the most intuitive. Security was efficient. However the BA lounge was overcrowded and noisy with minimal service and only basic comforts. Outbound flight on the A380. Boarding was rather chaotic due to the gate area being too small for such a large passenger compliment but the flight did push back on-time. The Club World cabin on the upper deck could best be described as grey and functional. It was reasonably clean if not spotless but despite being a relatively new aircraft it did feel slightly shabby already. The Club World seat which was forward facing and on the aisle was comfortable enough. The entertainment screen was rather small and the choice of movies wasn't terribly extensive but everything apart from the in-seat USB power socket was working. The general layout of the cabin was terrible. Not only do window seat and middle row passengers have to step over the legs of aisle seat passengers to get to and from their seats but when the privacy screen between seats is lowered for take-off landing and during meal services you find yourself staring rather disconcertingly close up into your neighbours face. It makes everything feel cramped and cheap. Meals were fine and the crew were polite and efficient. Overall I'd rate the outbound experience as 'Okay' for a business class flight. Return flight experience was far from okay. My flight departing IAD at 10.20 pm was cancelled 6 hours prior to departure due to mechanical issues. Told that there were no Club World seats on the earlier flight out of IAD that night which I could just about make at a push and I would have to fly back in Economy. When I asked about the BA flight from Baltimore (BWI) an hour later I was told that yes there were Club World seats available that evening so I asked to be rebooked onto that flight instead. Arriving at BWI check-in I was informed that unfortunately there actually weren't any Club World seats available and I would have to fly back in World Traveller Plus. The flight from BWI to LHR T5 was on a rather old 767. The cabin interior was dated shabby and cramped with minimal overhead luggage storage. World Traveller Plus seats were cramped and uncomfortable with tiny entertainment screens. In-flight food was bland. The crew were efficient but not terribly friendly. Flight left and arrived on time. As a UK passport holder Immigration at T5 was quick. Baggage reclaim took longer but bags arrived within five minutes of reaching the baggage hall.
1559,J Bacallado (Spain) 28th January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,MAD-LHR-JED club world 777-200. The overall product still good but need some update on aircraft and seat desing. Sometimes the window seat can fell a bit narrow with no extra space for your personals. On the other hand good service fast connection at LHR great lounge FA nice and attentive. IFE good choice of movies nice food (not great). Will fly them again.
1560,James Little (United Kingdom) 26th January 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Los Angeles (LAX) to London (LHR) in Club World. January 2015. Have not flown out of the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX for years but it's now much improved. Check in and bag drop a breeze as was security and in the oneworld lounge in minutes. Good choice of food and drinks and plenty of space. Short-ish walk to the gate good welcome on board and drinks served quickly. Couldn't fault any aspect of the experience and we took off and landed on time and managed a good five hours sleep out of the ten hours duration. Love the Arrivals Lounge at LHR. A civilising shower and 2nd breakfast sets you up for the day.
1561,Niall Farnan (United Kingdom) 26th January 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,"Took a return trip to Dublin over Christmas and found BA to be extremely disappointing. My principal complaint is the dirt - the seats and floor area looked as if they had not been cleaned for many flights. Also at 5'8"" I am not that tall but still found the seats cramped and uncomfortable."
1562,G Tonge (United Kingdom) 23rd January 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BKK-LHR was fearing the worst having read the reviews on here regarding the aisle seats where people have to step over you to get out. Relieved to say this didn't cause me any problems and I wasn't disturbed. Found the seat to be comfortable in both the upright and flat bed positions. Service from the cabin crew was adequately good. Food average. Entertainment system average.
1563,A Ferguson (Singapore) 23rd January 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-SIN on A380. First Class Seat 1K. Crew unprofessional most of the time forgot seat 1K existed with no welcome drink until 15 mins had passed no water top up until I asked (3 times) forgot wine match with first course and everything handed out with ""ok?"" as a comment. New tasting menu was very good. Had a flight in business with CX a few days later and the food quality crew and overall service was another league - far outshone BA. The BA First product is a waste of money and crew need a re-train."
1564,Jack Whiteley (United Kingdom) 23rd January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,London Gatwick to Mauritius 27th December return 7th January. 777 Aircraft economy class. I never travel economy class so it was a bit of an eye opener particularly on a 12 hour flight. The seats are far too close together and quite uncomfortable. In the middle seat the drop down tray was broken. When the passenger in front put his seat back I couldn't use the tray and when I asked the stewardess to ask him to put it forward a bit she just shrugged and said nothing. Poor unfriendly service and absolute rubbish food. BA are miles behind the Far and Middle East airlines and still charging more. I have no idea why people use them.
1565,P Brennan (United Kingdom) 23rd January 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Bangkok to London Heathrow. 8 Sep 2014. On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat. The flight was expensive but it had a good time slot and no stopover. Never again.
1566,D Rogers (Ireland) 23rd January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,"BA191 19th Jan London Heathrow to Austin. Legroom in economy is too small. I'm 6'2"" and just don't fit. On a long haul flight recently I sat with my knees sticking out into the aisle and adjacent seat space for 10 hours."
1567,Tony Vanovitch (United Kingdom) 23rd January 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,I returned from JFK last Friday morning reasonable flight although delayed for an hour and a half. Main meal was okay but the breakfast was appalling a stale croissant with some jam. I paid good money for this flight. Really disappointed quality is slipping away.
1568,C Legard (United Kingdom) 21st January 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,Delhi to London in seat 2A 747 aircraft. Very little difference between First and Business in comfort terms and the food was disgusting. Poor choice of entertainment. Only good thing I can remember was a nice white Burgundy but it was probably served in economy too. Will stick to business class in future for the airport fast tracking and lounges.
1569,Tarazi Marwan (United Kingdom) 21st January 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flying from LGW to MCO on a 772. Compared to last year the cabin was clean. Wide variety of food and beverages. Quality was good. BA is far behind a lot of airlines in business class. The seat is small if you are over 6 feet tall. Staff ok. They don't go out of their way. It seems that they are just doing their job. You don't see them between meals. They need to step up their game. I don't think BA is a 4 star airline. I would only recommend because of direct flight.
1570,Ian Robinson (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,We flew from Gatwick to Jamaica in November. Check in was easy and very quick and we were soon in the lounge. The lounge as usual was comfortable but with a very poor selection of food. As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area. As usual the crew turned the lights down as soon as dinner was cleared away but I did manage to read for a while and then sleep for 3 to 4 hours. Overall quite good and based on this experience I would recommend this product.
1571,P Dean (Australia) 19th January 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,London-Gatwick to Venice on 30 December 2014 everything went smoothly at check in no problems flight arrived safely. Info given during flight. No gluten free option given for snack during flight but got vegetarian option. Opted for a drink and own snack which I always have as stand by. Cabin crew seemed rushed but polite.
1572,Daniel W MacDonald (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,Heathrow to Newark on 787 aircraft. Plane clean and tidy excellent in flight entertainment good food and drink served by friendly staff. Overall excellent value for money. The Galleries Lounge at terminal 5B is an excellent space quiet for the time of day with plentiful food and drink.
1573,M Gibson (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.
1574,K Hindle (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,Just back from a fantastic 2.5 week trip to Thailand flying to and from Bangkok with BA on 777 aircraft. I definitely would choose another airline next time. We flew out on 31st December 2014 and the crew were surly and inattentive. Asking for a drink seemed as if it was really putting them out. One of the crew swore when communicating with her colleague during the drinks service within ear shot of us. Outbound they run out of the the meal choice for both very small meals by the time they reached us so we had to had the veggie option. For most of the flight the crew were camped in the galley at the back seemingly having a party with colleagues whether working or not so you felt it was a imposition to ask for water or snacks. My inflight entertainment system had streaks all across which couldn't be rubbed off making the movies very hard to see. Return flight crew on 16th Jan were much less surly but again conspicuous by their absence meaning you had to try and wade through the party at the back to try and get water or snacks during the flight. Two passengers were flicking raisins about the cabin onto other passengers which might have been spotted had the cabin crew had more of a presence. The inflight entertainment system had major issues which meant it didn't work on demand making it hard to plan viewing of movies. Again 2 very small meals at the either end of a 13 hr flight with very limited options for snacks in between. One staff member said they had very little left then allowed a passenger to grab about 5 packets for herself. Tray table was broken in seat 27b also. The crew said as it was an early flight they knew we all wanted to sleep but the flight left just before midday so not what I call a night flight. I used to love flying BA as have always been impressed with their service in the past but now the planes and the crew seem tired and I am sorry to say neither my partner or I enjoyed the experience. Will look to EVA Thai or one of the Middle Eastern airlines next time.
1575,A Cameron (Australia) 19th January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,BA 870 22nd Dec 2014. Flew from London to Budapest. Very satisfied with service staff friendly and professional. Even though this was a fairly short trip food and beverages were very satisfactory. Will definitely recommend this airline.
1576,E McIver (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,10/10,British Airways customer review,LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to fly on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.
1577,W Brash (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,"My wife and I travelled from Manchester to Las Vegas via Heathrow. The flight from Manchester was delayed and then on arrival at LHR the boarding passes which were fine at MAN were no good at LHR. We had to queue for over 2 hours to get more printed. Others with the same problem missed their main flights! The staff at LHR are rude jobsworth who take great pleasure in causing the maximum discomfort. The 747 seats on the LHR to LV flights were terrible like small deck chairs. Any leg/knee movement from the person behind was felt even with the pillow between me and the seat back. Compared with US Air the seats are much smaller and far more basic. Seating totally unsuitable for long haul flights. The entire cabin is extremely cramped the aisles are so narrow that anyone who is not slim tends to bang into your seat every time they pass. BA brought a whole new meaning to ""cattle class"" The cabin staff were efficient and professional the food was fine. I am not a large person certainly not overweight but I was badly cramped. I would never choose BA for a long haul flight again. We travel from Manchester to Las Vegas 2 or 3 times a year. BA is by far the worst carrier we have flown with especially when you add in the extra costs for seat selection etc. Very Poor!"
1578,S Blood (Spain) 19th January 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,Regularly travel from BCN to LHR. In addition to booting us out of T5 making international connection more difficult it is now using the newly refurb'd A320s on this route. The ones where BA sneaks another row of seats in between 1 and 10. Already faced with overpriced flights its now insisting on make journeys less comfortable. Less costs more.
1579,B Watts (United Kingdom) 19th January 2015,3/10,British Airways customer review,"I have not travelled with BA for almost 7 years as a result of moving to Asia and using carriers like AF/SQ/Emirates. I flew Premium from LHR to MIA on a 747 and horrified to see that the Premium product has not changed in the last 10 years. BA have quite an ageing fleet now when compared to most European and Asian carriers and it really shows. The entertainment screen was absolutely tiny and the charging point is still that ridiculous adapter for which you have to pay an arm and a leg so pleased I found mine from 7 years back! BA must go and have a look at the AF premium product for a wake up call. The food was okay nothing to rave about and perfectly satisfactory service onboard seems friendly and efficient however the state of the uniforms of some of the staff was shocking not sure if its a case of poor quality material or lack of attention to appearances. I do remember the strap line ""BA the worlds favourite airline"" but sadly they have slipped quite a long way back."
1580,S Reay (Australia) 14th January 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flew on 23 December from Shanghai to LHR in first. Only 3 of us in the cabin so service was excellent and very personal. Found the seat and bed both very comfortable and food and drink selection was excellent. IFE wasn't amazing - found stuff to watch but easily got bored. First lived up to my expectations on BA and I'd love to repeat it.
1581,S Bain (United Kingdom) 14th January 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,Wednesday 24th December - 787 Dreamliner LHR to Calgary in Club - Seat 3A. Used the lounges and managed to get a free facial in the Elemis spa. On entering the aircraft it was nice to see the big seats. However it took the staff at least 5 minutes to collect our coats. We were lucky we were travelling as a couple as it would be quite annoying if you were in 3B as the food is served over the dividing barrier. Food was very nice. Being next to the windows it was hard to hear the cabin announcements as the air circulation is quite loud. The windows are different as the change colour instead of the usual blinds. The seat design is very poor for those in seat a rows 1 2 and 6 as they have to step over the person in the row in front if they are lying down. 3A has its own access to the aisle. The seat is ok and does go to a flat bed but with it only being 6ft a lot of people will not be able to stretch out. Disembarking was chaos as the people from the other bit in club and premium tried to get off before us. We managed to get seats for £1000 return in the November sale - I would not like to have paid the usual £6k return as it is not value for money.
1582,R Rodway (United States) 14th January 2015,8/10,British Airways customer review,"Being an ex pat I decided to fly the flag from Seattle back to England in November 2014 to celebrate my 60th birthday. I was accompanied by my wife a son and daughter with their spouse's and our 2 year old grandson. Between us all we spent a considerable amount of money to fly economy class. After a short time into the flight we soon discovered the economy seats on the 777 to be extremely small uncomfortably close to the seats in front of us with almost no legroom and armrest that only fold up halfway! I wonder what genius came up with that one. Aside from serving us ""steerage"" passengers that stuff they called food and a drink we never saw the cabin crew in both directions. They wouldn't even come around to collect the trash so we sat amidst it. They didn't even check to see if my grandson needed anything. As far as flying BA again there wont be a next time."
1583,Mike Rickett (United Kingdom) 14th January 2015,1/10,British Airways customer review,I flew to Toronto from Manchester via T5 Heathrow on Dec 17 returning on Jan 5. I have no complaints about the inflight experience which was generally very good although I am not sure that premium economy is really worth the money. What I found completely annoying was the lack of air-bridges both on departure and arrival at T5 Heathrow. We were herded on to buses like cattle closely resembling the tube at rush hour and then had to climb steep steps into the aircraft no easy feat with heavy hand luggage and duty free. Are there not enough gates with air bridges at T5? Why is this necessary. I will be flying to Toronto again in September but I am not sure it will be with BA if this situation persists.
1584,T Jones (United Kingdom) 14th January 2015,7/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR to Denver Colorado on 26/12/14 - 6/1/15 for a ski holiday. Absolutely disappointed and outraged at the rubbish food served on both flights and obviously what I consider as edible and what BA class as edible we shall truly disagree on - awful food. Coffee rubbish asked for more water and never got any? The inflight entertainment was also poor and a film was stopped after 30 minutes to reboot the system for other passengers. The male stewards were fine and happy but one of the female stewardesses was miserable and we felt we were putting her out asking for a drink which never arrived anyway? Thought BA had got rid of that superior lucky to fly with us attitude! Will not fly them again if I can help it.
1585,B Morrison (United Kingdom) 11th January 2015,4/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-SFO-LHR. Why do I keep thinking BA will improve? The 747 on this route is falling to bits. Their business class configuration is terrible. Facing a complete stranger having to attempt to climb over other passenger to go to bathroom! Seat narrow and table unusable for dinner unless use knee to hold it up! Food on both legs awful but worse coming from SFO. Also club kitchen pathetic. IFE systems the worst of any airline. BA please travel on Emirates just once and see how it should be done. Staff on way out on upper deck very nice and attentive however on return to LHR on upper deck staff were verging on ""can't be bothered""! Served dinner during severe turbulence which you could not eat so they could get dinner finished and sit down for rest of flight. Had to go to galley to get drink as ignored call button. Then empties sat on table for two hours before I dumped them in galley. Breakfast consisted of hard fruit and greasy bacon tiny roll. Both of which left uneaten. I keep booking through blind loyalty but after Bahrain and San Fran in December decided no more. They have just got too bad."
1586,R Anderson (United Kingdom) 11th January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,Muscat - Abu Dhabi - London. Delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. No welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. Not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. No cabin checks done on one side ex Abu Dhabi. Menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. Crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience.
1587,Bob Kumar (United Kingdom) 11th January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,The last trip was in Nov to Washington flew first in the new A380 which is a great aircraft very spacious cabin and extremely quiet. Service and drinks choice fine but their food is always questionable. On the way out had the tasting menu which was good even had two dishes repeated but on the return chose the chicken in a mushroom sauce! This was disgusting and after two bites sent it back. This is not the first time BA's food has been suspect either their club Europe service to Gibraltar also serves up light cold snacks though charging up to £750 return for a 2.5hour flight. For those looking to fly BA the lounges aircraft and staff are good to go but the food needs to be improved.
1588,M Lomax (United Kingdom) 11th January 2015,9/10,British Airways customer review,We flew from Manchester to LHR to YCC and return over the Christmas period on the Dreamliner. The only comfortable section of the journey was the short trip to and from London. The Dreamliner is narrow and uncomfortable. We had read the reviews and were hopeful it would be better than the reviews. The 3-3-3 seating is far too cramped with narrow seats the leg room was just about acceptable. We sat in the back row of the front cabin of economy by choice as it reduced the risk of being kicked from behind. It was a good choice but pick the side without rest rooms behind you as the toilets are very noisy and busy. The food was typical air line food. The crew were variable. On the outward journey the crew were great but on the return less pleasant. The lights were dimmed late in the flight and the crew did not use the variable lighting to gradually light the cabin and just flicked the switch. We are returning to Canada in a few months but we will not be using BA despite my husbands Executive Club membership. BA are still great for short haul but they need to rethink the Dreamliner experience.
1589,Kayleigh Collins (Japan) 11th January 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled from London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda overall not a very pleasurable experience. The seats were uncomfortable blankets were of poor quality. Seats were crammed too close to one another the pillow provided was also of poor quality. The entertainment system was great for TV shows but terrible for movies only one headphone worked and occasionally the sound would black out the system suffered a few malfunctions but smoothed out once up in the air. The food was delicious but the tea and coffee was poor. Staff service was good but still lots of room for improvement. The aircraft and the experience itself seemed old and dated compared to other carriers I have flown with.
1590,R Schroeder (United Kingdom) 5th January 2015,5/10,British Airways customer review,HAM-LHR Club Europe Seat 2F new cabin. Dear oh dear - surely no one within BA could have said this seat as adequate for people paying a premium. I find the new seat absolutely horrible. It's very tight and I am unable to use my laptop. Flying BA Club Europe is no longer justifiable because its no longer possible to work during the flight. Yes the luggage rack moved to eye level. It does not give the 4 inches or so lost by moving the seats closer together. Seats are also very hard and extremely uncomfortable. Dear BA - please reconsider this terrible new seat an attractive cabin alone does not make for a business class that is useful to business people.
1591,David Russell (United Kingdom) 5th January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,BA662 26/12/14 LHR-LCA Economy Seat 27K. 37 minutes late leaving Heathrow but that's not unusual for this service made up some of the time but still arrived 30 minutes late into Larnaca. Flight was on an old Boeing 767 - the seating was a bit too firm and not very comfortable. This seat was an exit row so leg room was superb. Gets a little cold here but OK for a flight of this duration. No personal video on demand just old overhead screen system so next to useless. They replace the seats but not the entertainment system and on a flight like this of over four hours it should be better. Food was pretty good with a choice of salad or hot meal with the usual free beverages. Cabin crew were OK nothing special and we never got a pass by the duty free either for some reason they missed out rows 27J/K towards the back. Flight crew gave good flight information and updates. Luggage arrived OK at destination. So to sum up very ordinary very average very late.
1592,Morrison Jack (United Kingdom) 5th January 2015,6/10,British Airways customer review,"Travelled Club from MIA to LHR last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare AA flight (which was excellent!) We paid an extra £170 to pre-book seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. It's been several years since I last tried BA Club on a transatlantic flight and I was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. Compared to the Emirates business class I'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before BA are fast becoming the 'Lada' of the Airline business. The seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But worst of all the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! My wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the Cabin Crew first offered her one then said ""Oh sorry of course you're vegetarian!"" and that was it - no alternative! Never again BA!"
1593,C Pedersen (United Kingdom) 5th January 2015,2/10,British Airways customer review,Had a good BA flight out to Barcelona but found on return switched to Vueling. On this flight we had to pay for refreshments. I wrote in to BA to complain and had no reply. After several weeks I re-wrote and eventually received an apology but no explanation as to why we had to pay for food.
1594,David Walsh (United Kingdom) 31st December 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR-CPH in business class on 23rd December 2014. New cabin and seats are a vast improvement and the new clean planes are good. Food was ok with an afternoon tea. Lots of drinks offered and the flight caught up the delay on departure. Nice friendly staff too.
1595,R Simpson (Australia) 31st December 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,My wife and I flew business class upstairs on the A380 Hong Kong to LHR flight BA 26 on the 21/12/14 seats 51 K and J. We found the seats comfortable and the window seat was private with plenty of storage my wife found the reverse to be true of the aisle seat getting out of the window seat is quite tricky. We found the food to be quite tasty. We had the beef tenderloin for dinner which was cooked nicely and tasted very good. The cooked English breakfast was also good. The plane was clean and new looking and the toilets were clean and fresh. Staff service on the whole was reasonable however they did very little other than the main meal services also the head FA was particularly unfriendly bordering on rude. Will we fly BA again after our return on the 23/1/15? Maybe if they are considerably cheaper or Cathay Pacific are full.
1596,James Walters (United States) 31st December 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,SAN-MUC for a conference. I hold Oneworld Sapphire status yet the BA website didn't recognize and wanted to charge me for advanced seat assignments. After several phone calls with no solution BA finally called American Airlines to verify my status and assigned my seats in advance. Check in at SAN was cramped and disorganized. No offer to upgrade to the next class of service (biz class was only 1/4 full). Lounge was amazing! Boarded the 777-200 3 class service. The plane was outdated. No outlets to charge iPhone/iPad. PVOD screen was slightly bigger than an iPhone 6 screen. PVOD control on the inside of the seat. One slight move and the volume or channel changed. Very frustrating. The cabin crew clearly couldn't care less about the passengers. Meal service wasn't started until 2 hours after take off - very slow. Seats were hard and chipped and broken. I'll never fly the SAN-LHR route again with this equipment. I had better expectations. Turkish and ANZ premium economy are significantly better. However I switched back to Oneworld and don't have many choices. BA needs to up their game if they expect to remain competitive in the global world. AA is even better in economy.
1597,N Bhettay (Ireland) 31st December 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Really like the new business class cabins on the BA A380 (LHR-JNB) - the dimmed lighting is so civilized and much more conducive to long haul travel and getting some sleep. Why do we need to have those ridiculous lights in cabins on so bright? Chairs seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is the first row of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel. Not great for business class sleeping and poor design there. Great service and food and beverages continue to be high quality great menus also good entertainment selection. Didn't even notice takeoff (which was delayed) as movies etc available before take off. Very good.
1598,Clive V Drake (United Kingdom) 31st December 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,"Washington - LHR. We arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new BA Executive lounge. It is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. Plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. The food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. No complaints so far. We were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the A380. Seats 50A and 50B. I was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. I hope this weird seating design is changed in the near future. It was the so called latest Club World seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. In fact the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. It has been some time since I have flown Club - the last being on a 777 to Antigua in 2010. I am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. We pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed I well put it this way tried to get some sleep. It was a horrendous experience. In 35 years of aviation travel I have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! I simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. The temperature was fine. Noise level was minimal. The ""bed"" was rock hard. To narrow. To short. The seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. I arrived into LHR without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. I had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 Club product - and back then I was 20 kilos heavier. This product is not cheap (On some sectors its as high as £7000 return) - although we purchased our tickets on Avios - with a 1st Class outbound and Club return. The saving grace was a strong tail wind that shot us across the pond in 6.5 hours. I couldn't wait to get off."
1599,John Frewen-Lord (United Kingdom) 31st December 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,A380 to Hong Kong WT+. Wonderful plane slept for a number of hours (which for me is all but unheard of). Food much better than I was expecting considering that WT+ is supposed to get the same food as WT. Plane left on time and arrived early. Crew friendly - I had little call to ask them for much but any request was quickly attended to. Return from Bangkok incoming flight (and hence departure from BKK) delayed to ATC in UK BA provided voucher which was more than enough for a good sized breakfast. 777 nowhere near as nice as the A380 noisy seats less comfortable and I got barely any sleep on this 13h flight. FAs not as attentive as going out but no real complaints. Poor choice of entertainment on very small screen. Overall quite good and fair value for money in WT+.
1600,Waddell Ian (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,London-Prague-London. Smart new-looking A320 from T3 which was nice. Early flight so no delays ahead of the ATC cock-up that day. Good crew there and back on time and generally excellent service. The one thing which places BA apart from Easyjet (I won't even mention Ryanair) is the speed of cabin service because no money changes hands. On Easyjet the trolley makes glacial progress down the aisle whereas on BA things move much more quickly.
1601,G Tonge (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Very satisfactory flight with British Airways from London to Bangkok. Was expecting the worst having read some of the reviews on here. I had one of the window seats where you don't have to climb over somebody to get out and this seat compared favourably with some of the higher ranked airlines as it offers excellent privacy. Everything from check in to departure was seamless and apart from the AVOD which is pretty dated everything else on board was very satisfactory.
1602,Steven Miller (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,British Airways are not interested in providing normal business class comforts and cuisine or even lounges on some routes. The Cancun route and the Nassau routes I have flown recently show this clearly as they are presumably are not bothered with little or no competition at all. This saddens me that they have made a clear decision that on holiday type routes they will provide the absolute minimum on everything. One example that shows how pathetic it has become with cutbacks out of many problems I encountered on these routes is that the food was so awful on the Cancun flight recently that we merely asked for cheese and biscuits in business class to be told that we could only have one packet of two biscuits each as BA only allocated one packet per person. The staff all agree that this was pathetic! No lounges at both these airports either and queuing of business class and economy all together no attempt to really show you paid extra for your ticket.
1603,M Gavin (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew GLA-LHR-JFK return trip on 3rd December returned on 8th. Domestic flight was excellent both ways the new cabin is lovely breakfast was very good cabin crew very professional. LHR-JFK sector was excellent. Although the 747 cabin is extremely worn the aircraft are being replaced in due course. The crew were very attentive and provided plenty of drinks the meal was lovely too. On the way back the turbulence was severe and there were a lot of frightened passengers the crew were very calm and reassuring and helped ease anxieties round the cabin.
1604,H Kieran (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew with BA back in June from London Heathrow (LHR) - Rome (FCO) outbound in Club Europe return in Economy. Outbound flight on an A321 in business great service relaxing and comfortable improved greatly being addressed by name by the crew who were very funny and friendly great food and drinks on flight leaving London at 8:30 in the morning. Return on a 767 in Economy great service and very relaxing brilliant food and drink even in Economy and once again friendly crew and brilliant seats. After a few trips over the months it appears BA is definitely improving with such brilliant service!
1605,Robert Wright (United Kingdom) 22nd December 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,TPA - LGW on Dec 10th in PE. BA have total monopoly on the London/Tampa rout and don't they know it. I fly this about every six weeks or so normally in Club World but sometimes in Premium just due to the huge price variance. The quality of the planes on this route but more importantly the service and staff attitude are way below the standard you would expect and this trip was no exception. Old plane miserable arrogant staff and poor service. I pray every time I fly that another carrier will take up a slot at Tampa as it's a growing airport and when they do BA will definitely lose my business and I suspect many others.
1606,J Smith (United States) 18th December 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I cannot believe that BA calls their plane from Austin to London a ""Dreamliner"". I'm sitting in their so called ""club world"" which is the equivalent to Americans business class and this plane is awful! There is no room to put anything at all. Everything and I mean everything goes in storage. You are literally looking straight at the person next to you. Attendants are rude. Don't waste your money. While its nice to go non-stop between Austin and London this will be the last time I ever take this flight."
1607,Boone Pieter (Netherlands) 18th December 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,AMS-LHR-JNB and CPT-LHR-AMS in club. 767 between Amsterdam and London is just wonderful Love the front cabin. A380 to JNB. This was a late departure. I could see - from the lounge - the A380 arrive at the stand some 30 minutes prior to boarding obviously arriving late from another destination and even though it doesn't require a lot of inside-knowledge to see that such a plane can not be 'turned around' in 60 minutes. However BA did not feel there would be a delay until it called all it's premium passengers from the lounge and had them lined up in 4 separate lanes in front of the counter then announcing a delay of 15 then 30 then 45 minutes: How to get your most appreciated customers furious never hear so many complaints on an airline even before the flight started: terrible ground management: not a good start. Upperdeck club seating is absolutely wonderful and this plane is so quiet that you can hear everything. Never realized how much snoring is going on at night first time I had to use earplugs. Food was just terrible and how BA gets away with having pepper and salt in the cheapest of the cheapest sachets just baffles me. The flight to Jo'burg was obviously done by the more senior crew who have incredible charm wit and the most entertaining sense of humor. That opposed to the 'new crew' on the way back from Cape Town. Old 747 with spacious seating all fine. Crew stressed running all the time no manners no sense of class and definitely no sense of humor. Food was slightly better on this long flight but way below any other European carrier I flew. It was my first time in club on BA I love the seat very comfortable for sleeping. There is a lack of space to put your stuff but other than that: a really nice product. BA lounges definitely stand out in the level of catering (food). Transfer at LHR T 5 was quick and easy but terminal itself is a tacky shopping mall and how - so soon after being delivered as new - half of it was blocked for remodelling. My return to Amsterdam on a new A319 was great. Good breakfast and seating is fine.
1608,R King (United Kingdom) 18th December 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled JFK - LHR late November. The Concorde Room: very nice indeed food not that good for once. Seat 1K: fine comfortable enough but no space at all for small things - even the wardrobe had no storage space. Just room for the coat and shoes below. This compares with American Airlines Business Class which had essentially the same seat loads of storage space and good privacy. AA Business class is equivalent to BA First Class. The service was fantastic as always with BA. Cup of tea excellent and breakfast good. Toiletries bag was fine with all the items needed. Toilet a bit naff for First Class. Value for money simply because the deal I got was really good - BA always do deals late November. Otherwise it would have been poor value. However AA are preferred - BA do not have WiFi.
1609,Tom Gleinser (United States) 18th December 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,"We flew ""Business/1st class"" from London to Dublin and then Berlin to London recently on an Airbus A-130 (like a 737). Three seats on a side. The only thing different from coach was they put a tray table over the center seat. The seats were as cramped as Southwest airlines. The service was excellent but the seats made it a bad deal."
1610,Bell Neill (United States) 10th December 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,"LAX-LHR-LAX on the A380.The first thing I noticed: You can no longer upgrade with Avios. Unlike the days of BA Miles any attempt just brings up ""No Availability"" or the web-site simply tries to make you buy an upgrade. Not a good start. Next up at LAX the plane was a good hour late arriving. Finally boarded and the flight was OK. Food was from the Club World menu (WTP) seating fine enough wine good IFE but then landing late at LHR a delay because ""An airbus was at our spot"". Next the airbridge will not work followed by an airbus is in our spot. Over 35 minutes wasted sitting there with children bullying passengers. If the pilot wishes to lie please be consistent. Route back all quite normal but I feel somehow BA have thrown the baby out with the bath water. As a share holder I prefer discounts to dividends which are doubtful ad I preferred using miles to upgrade (try finding flights from the US you can book with ""Avios"" and finally why did that pilot lie to all of us sat there waiting to park? Time to stop collecting miles change credit cards and look for an honest airline I feel."
1611,Neil Balter (United States) 10th December 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Phoenix to London - outbound a wonderful and enjoyable experience. The problem we had started on our return flight home. We boarded the plane and were disappointed to find out that we were in the old style first class. After being in the new cabin on the way out the old configuration is very run down and there was a rip in the seat. I was attempting to work but when I went to plug in my laptop battery I found that there was no adapter for me to use. Since I could no longer work I decided to put a movie on. The tiny screen in the old first class was just pathetic. The flight attendants did their absolute best to make up for the issues and I give them high marks for trying as hard as they possibly could to accommodate me. I decided to walk to the back and visit a friend who was also on the flight. You can imagine my surprise when I saw him sitting in business class with a TV screen bigger than mine a plug for his laptop and a new seat. At this point it became obvious to me that the rest of the cabin both coach and business class had been upgraded. It doesn't make sense to me. Just when we thought it could not get any worse we landed in Phoenix to face another issue. We waited 45 minutes for our bags before being told that our luggage was still in London. We've flown on this flight before and had the same issue of our luggage not being on the plane. The difference is that we were informed before landing that our baggage hadn't made it and that they would have it delivered directly to our home. Well this time nobody informed us so we stood there waiting for 45 minutes at the baggage claim before we were told.
1612,I Lancaster (United Kingdom) 10th December 2014,na,British Airways customer review,LHR to IST in economy. Excellent! I thought it was a new A320 but FA told me it was not new it was refurbished. Well done BA on a good re-design: new lighting seats clever seat-back storage etc. I believe they've reduced the economy seat pitch but the design is such that you don't notice. Dinner was served on this evening flight - a very tasty Chicken curry with cheese/crackers and chocolate mousse desert. A very decent meal for a 4-hour flight in economy. FAs were courteous and efficient. The only negative was security at LHR T5 where there was a long delay because of installation of new machines and security alert that morning.
1613,Donna Burchett (United States) 4th December 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,IAH-LHR B747 which was old but sat upstairs and it made it very pleasant. They charged $129 extra to reserve a business class seat in the upper deck. Do not care for the seating of one seat forward and one backwards. The food was terrible and they did not really want to serve any drinks unless they had too. Felt like I was in economy. Nuts were in a bag and breakfast was not much better. Flight attendants not very friendly.
1614,T Harvey (Canada) 4th December 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,YVR-LHR-AMS. An uneventful journey with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver was a flashback to the 1990's. Dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating. Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.
1615,Derek Salter (South Africa) 4th December 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Have just completed four flights with British Airways all in Economy and all long-haul. Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant. Heathrow T5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section (A) can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details.
1616,J Dob (United States) 4th December 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,British Airways for some reason was incapable of seating me next to my husband during our recent 8 hour flight. We made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. When we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. Which is strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason. While it's always fun to meet new strangers we will not be flying with British Airways again.
1617,Vincent Borlaug (United States) 4th December 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,BA216 from Washington to London in World Traveller Plus on BA's new A380 (upper level) - one of the smoothest quietest flights I've experienced in 45 years of flying. Practically everything went off perfectly - less jet noise than on other aircraft decent food great leg-room and seat width a relaxing cabin layout and a top-notch cabin crew (no rating for entertainment since apart from the flight tracker I don't use it) - even the boarding and disembarkation despite being on two levels seemed more orderly than in the past on other aircraft. A success all round.
1618,Colin Pay (United Kingdom) 4th December 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-BGO on A319. Flight on time and only half full. Drinks and snack on this early departure. Crew very good.
1619,H Lowe (United Kingdom) 4th December 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-SFO-LHR. Out in economy and return in economy plus both in a 747-400. Outbound seating was in the V2 configuration meaning that no exit seats were available but did manage a bulkhead seat which made the journey more pleasant. Staff on this flight were quite poor forgot to serve me dinner and disregarded the call button literally had to physically stop the steward in the aisle to get service. Return in PE cost an extra £240 which is quite steep but the dinner was better as was the space and seat. Service on return was excellent. Breakfast really disappointing cereal bar and a bag of dried fruit who on earth in management in BA came up with this menu?
1620,L Cameron-Lewis (Canada) 25th November 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Check-in in Toronto was OK no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate. On the plus side the aircraft was immaculately clean clearly quite new and the inbound flight was spot on time.
1621,J Rodder (United Kingdom) 25th November 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,London City to Florence. LCY is a great stress free airport. On time flight great crew and a really good economy service. We expected the usual BA biscuit or snack but were served a tasty couscous and chicken salad with dessert with plenty of drinks. BA offers a good product from LCY.
1622,Business (Thailand) 25th November 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,HKG-LHR-Bergen: Stockholm-LHR-HKG - A380 on long haul/A319 for short haul. I always like the forward Club cabin on BA's A380 Upper Deck despite the 7-across seating making it seem a bit cramped. Short delay to outward sector due to technical problems some of which had not been ironed out on take off. The screen dividers IFE and then the seat reclines had problems and required resetting. It was an hour before these were sorted out. My main concern on long-haul is merely sleep. The Qantas lounge in HKG is excellent and so no need to have dinner in flight. Also skipped breakfast as there is an excellent one in the Arrivals lounge. With BA having cancelled the morning flight to Bergen about 5 months after I booked my ticket I was stuck with a lengthy 12-hour connection. En route to Bergen the service for just 10 Club passengers was poor - way below expectations. With only 12 meals boarded of which 6 were a fish curry that no-one wanted (curry on a Norway flight?) 4 of us were stuck with sandwiches from the back. No tea or coffee service unless specifically requested. Return to LHR from Stockholm was a huge improvement. Friendly service quick drinks service and tasty lunch. Slept most of the way back to HKG again deciding not to eat or watch any IFE. In that respect the flight was excellent.
1623,John Geoffrey Pierson (United States) 25th November 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,NBO-LHR Club world and LHR-BOS in economy: generally a pleasant and comfortable experience. I have difficulty reconciling our positive experiences with the negative comments about flight attendants in other posts here. As we boarded in Nairobi the purser welcomed us by name and said how pleased they were to have us back again on BA. Before take-off from London a flight attendant offered the third person in our row a different seat leaving my wife and me with a vacant seat between us. In all cases attendants were helpful cheerful and efficient. Obviously in Club World staff have more time to spend with passengers. With the exception of the late night dinner out of Nairobi we were impressed with the meal selection and quality. Flights were on time; checked baggage arrived in good condition. Agree that having to pay to reserve seats (if you are not of sufficient One World status) is disappointing. Generally we remain very pleased with British Air certainly the best One World option to Europe and beyond from Boston.
1624,Saketh Rahm (United States) 20th November 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,SFO-LHR-DXB and return DXB-LHR-DEN outbound in premium economy return in business. Positives were all flights on time and crews were overall great on all sectors. Was able to upgrade return at check in at DXB for about $1000 which I thought was worth it. I was not too impressed with WTP product - I still had to pay to get assigned seats which is ridiculous when you are paying extra anyway. The 747 the product looks old and tired. Menu is the same as economy even though they advertise that catering includes a business class entree. Catering out of LHR was absolutely atrocious - almost like a TV dinner which is strange as this is their main hub. Return in Club world was a decent product. Lounge had hot breakfast and was quite big and food onboard was reasonable. Second meal service (high tea) was a joke with pre-packaged sandwiches - not too classy. Overall an okay experience but leagues behind EK/SQ/CX. Not sure when European airlines when if ever will catch up.
1625,D von Bergen (United Kingdom) 20th November 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,I travel to and from Singapore on BA in Club world most months but this was my first time on the A380 for this trip. On the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed. Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved but it can be crowded. Club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.
1626,Eric Martin (France) 20th November 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew with my wife LHR-JNB BA055 on an A380 October 31st and back JNB-LHR BA056 November 15th in Business Class. British Airways has invented ""High Density Business Class"" or ""Sardines Business Class"". 8 abreast on the main deck and 7 abreast on the upper deck this cabin configuration is very strange. To be fair the seat itself is comfortable enough to be able to sleep but it is so narrow that you have almost nothing to store any belongings. You are facing your neighbour and if you seat on a middle seat the access to the aisle is not easy at all. You have no view outside except if you have a window seat. You have the impression of flying in a submarine! On the other hand if you are a little bit claustrophobic fly the competitors. The IFE is OK the screen is large enough but the film selection is under average. The service is good food and beverage OK. To summarize as long as BA proposes (very) attractive fare (that was the case) I will fly again BA if not I will fly the competitors."
1627,Paul Wilson (United Kingdom) 20th November 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,London Heathrow to Zagreb return in economy. Used the BA app to check in at both airports. Both flights on time. I found the crew were friendly and got the job done. They appeared to enjoy their work. The flight back from Zagreb was almost completely full - but the crew were good and ensured that everyone was catered for.
1628,R Schroeder (United Kingdom) 20th November 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-MAD Club Europe A320 Seat 2A 15.25 hrs departure: Newly refurbished cabin looked very classy in dark brown leather. Crew was excellent was start to finish. However those new seats are a catastrophe. There is not enough leg room they hardly recline and it's not possible work on a laptop. That's in Business Class. It is just like Easyjet seating but with a business fare price tag. Food consisted of some finger sandwiches and a scone with jam. Really? The flight gets in just before 19.00 hrs local time. Wouldn't a light dinner be more appropriate? Terrible disappointing experience. These new seats have to go and food must improve.
1629,Kari Strouse (United States) 20th November 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,"MIA-LHR-BKK round trip club world three 777 and one 747. Check-in wait time is short for all flights. Fast pass through passport control and or security at Heathrow and Bangkok a big time-saver. Priority boarding smooth and relatively fast. Miami lounge shared with other airlines but excellent selection of comfortable seating food and drink. Heathrow lounges food offerings lacking. Small Bangkok lounge serviceable but Wi-Fi was down. Cabin service in general good with fairly attentive staff. I did however receive an unprofessional and snide comment about ordering a fourth Kir Royale on my last leg despite the fact that there were six hours left in the flight and I was not showing any signs of drunkenness. I did not pay $8500 to be insulted by cabin crew. Food over the four flights was inconsistent ranging from tasty to inedible. IFE showed the same movies on all four flights despite the fact that I flew in two different markets and my return was a full month after outbound flight. As I am only 5'3"" tall the seat was more than adequate though I could see how taller people would have a problem with it. Also I find it ridiculous that you must pay to choose your seat more than 24 hours before flight. Aisle seats are preferable as those on the inside must climb over the feet of the aisle passenger to get out into the aisle. Good overall experience except for a few pointed gaffes. On the fence as to whether the price is worth it."
1630,Hemsley Paul (United Kingdom) 20th November 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Dallas Fort Worth Texas to London Heathrow BA 192 7th November 2014. Economy yes but rude staff poor food and uncomfortable seats. I travel with many airlines and used to enjoy BA so what's gone wrong.
1631,J Teoh (Australia) 20th November 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-VIE in Club Europe on A320. Plane was an ex-BMI aircraft so it still had the old seats which are wider than the refurbished aircraft. Aircraft was clean and well-maintained. Good amount of legroom in row 1. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Seat was comfortable. On-board catering reasonably good with champagne offered. Flight was on time. Luggage delivered with priority. No IFE offered. Happy to fly with BA again if price remains competitive.
1632,D Turner (United Kingdom) 17th November 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Just flew to and from New York JFK with BA flight out was great modern plane comfy seats and cabin crew who seemed to enjoy their jobs. Unfortunately the flight back was very different old tired jumbo plane poor seating poor in-flight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly couldn't be bothered and everything seemed to be too much trouble. Plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the air-con on nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. Have flown long haul with Virgin and Cathay Pacific and these were much better on all fronts would only consider BA in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers!
1633,K McCarthy (United Kingdom) 17th November 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,I had a very poor experience with BA from Jo'burg to London was cancelled. We were kept on the tarmac for four hours with very little information and eventually told there was a technical fault so we would not be flying for another 24 hours. I needed to call my workplace to arrange work cover but the cabin staff said there was no BA phone I could use. Passengers had to go back through immigration in the middle of the night there was chaos around the baggage reclaim and a real lack of information from ground staff who appeared to have little direction on what to do. We were eventually taken at 4 am to a hotel where the hotel staff were unable to cope with the numbers needing rooms - families were separated. BA did not publicise the right of all passengers to EU compensation but I knew about this so did apply and receive the legally required amount promptly. All in all this was a hugely disappointing and frustrating experience from an airline that had previously been my preferred airline and I would no longer recommend BA.
1634,J Crane (United Kingdom) 17th November 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew MCT to LHR on 1 Nov 14. Staff at Muscat were excellent and could not have been more helpful to my wife (who is a wheelchair user). Catering on the flight was awful. Food was inedible and we were only served two drinks over an 11hr flight. On arrival the staff seemed to not know that she was a wheelchair user (despite having assistance booked in advance) which meant a stressful wait on the plane while here wheelchair was found and a lift ordered. We flew out on Oman air that was faster cheaper more comfortable had decent food and better informed staff.
1635,Clive V Drake (United Kingdom) 17th November 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!
1636,Paul Karagounis (Spain) 12th November 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,Kingston - London Gatwick in club world. Check in and fast track very efficient without any delays. Lounge surprisingly good comfortable with a reasonable selection of food and drinks inclusive of sushi rolls and bar service with cocktails and champagne. It must be on of the best lounges in West Indies. Priority boarding excellent. Business class passengers are escorted to the gate. Entering the plane and during the entire flight greeted and addressed by name. Staff very efficient friendly and smiling - willing to assist during the entire overnight flight. Relatively new plane with comfortable flat bed seats and a good entertainment system. Good selection of movies. Dinner and breakfast of a good standard and a great selection of spirits wine and champagne. Child's meal very thoughtfully done. Slept for 6 hours. Flight on time and swift luggage delivery. High standard of service with excellent value for money.
1637,Roger Bowler (France) 12th November 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-JNB 15/10. I cannot understand why BA have chosen the seating arrangement in Club World on the new A380 with one seat facing forward and the seat next to you facing backwards so as to be facing your neighbour. Food reasonable and service OK but not overly attentive. Return flight in Premium Economy seats not as comfortable as in the 767.
1638,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 12th November 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BA to Munich. Quick check-in good boarding sandwich wasn't the best 'evening meal' I have ever had but adequate on a short flight. Good crew. Exemplary crew on return flight. Nice airbus with comfy leather seats. Both flights on time/slightly early.
1639,Desai Naveen (United States) 12th November 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Worst experience from Bangalore to Heathrow - delayed and connecting flight from LHR to San Diego was missed. They put us on a flight to Chicago with seats in the middle of Premium Economy. We had booked bassinet seats on our missed flight. Chicago to San Diego on United - seats were not together. Overall a pathetic experience. Would never travel with BA.
1640,N Harvey (United Kingdom) 6th November 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Sunday 2/11 Dublin to Heathrow. Flight arrived late and departed even later due to the absolutely ridiculous length of time it took to board people. Finally got to my seat to discover a young girl with two kids occupying it. Shifted them out the way and continued. Had to help this girl with the seat belt for the child as no one seemed to have explained to her what to do. Flight was late so had to run out of terminal 5 which is no mean feat. If you are not in a rush use British Airways otherwise pick another airline.
1641,Rob Jones (United Kingdom) 6th November 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LGW-ACE-LHR. Arrived at Gatwick and was greeted at the check in counter by a friendly member of BA ground staff our bags were taken and we proceeded toward fast track security this was effortless and after a few minutes we were in the BA galleries lounge. I find that the BA lounge at Gatwick offers a very poor service early in the morning all you are likely to get food wise is warm toast pastries and condiments! The flight boarded on time and priority was given to those flying in the premium cabin I proceeded onto the plane and was greated by the purser who showed me to my seat and took my coat. After take off the inflight service consisted of a hot English breakfast which was very nice followed by tea/coffee - this is an early flight so no other drink service was offered however the purser did ask each passenger individually if they would like anything from the bar. Very friendly and attentive crew who addressed each passenger by their name which was a nice touch. The return flight to Heathrow was also very good the lounge at Alicante is typical of those in Spain rows of uncomfortable seating with inedible food offerings! Again another uneventful boarding process the purser on this flight was very attentive and spoke to everyone individually the meal tasted delicious chicken curry and rice. All in all BA offer a good Club Europe service they are trying to cut back and this often shows they need to consider upgrading their product or risk losing out to the likes of Easyjet or Ryanair.
1642,T Chamberlain (United Kingdom) 6th November 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,London Gatwick to Tampa and return BA2167 and 2166. Outbound flight departure was delayed for over an hour due to 'technical problems'. 90 minutes late arriving. In flight service to economy poor very few drinks people having to go to the galley to get water or juice. Special meal on return awful and inedible. We ordered the same but got a different dish. Didn't eat it. Return flight delayed over an hour due to sick passenger which necessitated return to stand and passenger/ bag offload. Entertainment system unreliable screen cutting out. Check in staff in Tampa told us we had no seats despite having printed boarding passes! Turned out her computer was on the wrong day! They were good overall and lenient on baggage weight.
1643,E Simeone (Belgium) 5th November 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,BRU-Toronto-BRU 1st class. In BRU check in passport control (very long queues) security fast track and lounge just fine but nothing very special. Security in T5 with extra long queues and very little fast track. Almost none. Lounge in T5 a bliss in all respects. Boarding ok although gate in T5b miles away. Flight itself a disaster old tatty B747 in need of an urgent revamp. Very used and ran down seats. Cabin full so crew although quite experienced busy food options were gone fast and service not that great as in the past. Ran out of champagne. Food not good at all. Inflight entertainment and videos a bore with very old titles. Bags not first out. Return again same experience although a 777 good check in and security fast track - lounge ok with option to dine before flying which I took in case food was same disaster as flight in. Not full cabin this time so a little better service although quality is still zero. Again London T5 lounge a breeze and fast and short flight to BRU.
1644,C Polson (Australia) 3rd November 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,BA 0027 ex London HR to Hong Kong which departed 30/9/14. Hong Kong to London Sector on 17/9/14. Inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible- no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. It was a relief to get onto Cathay Pacific flight for next stage of my journey. How can two airlines be so different? British Airways is a disgrace.
1645,V Carrapiett (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,We travelled economy from Manchester to Toronto via Heathrow The flight from Manchester to Heathrow and return was very good. The seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. The service from the cabin crew was excellent. The leg from Heathrow to Toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. The seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. Whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. Unfortunately BA were let down by the attendants on the return leg from Toronto to Heathrow. Whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable I have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. We had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. The lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. The steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. He did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. Even after take off she had to ask again. When they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. The steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. This had not appeared by the time I had finished eating my meal so I gave her the bottle from mine (My daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) Shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. The passengers on the other aisle were served about 15 mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. I asked for a glass of orange and a tea (as I had not drunk anything on the 6 hour flight). The attendant scowled at me and then gave me half a glass of orange and half a cup of tea (which was cold|) I did not see the attendants down our aisle smile at a customer once throughout the whole journey.
1646,S Tilton (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,Flight LGW to TFS in Business. Like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. Seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour short-haul narrower and with materially less leg-room than before the same as economy. Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. One wants to like and use BA but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. Unusually in my experience one of the FAs was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too.
1647,Ed Warren (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LGW - MCO 26th October. Was a bit worried about BA after a lot of mixed reviews. Found the whole experience great. We were travelling with a 4 month old and the crew were faultless. So helpful and caring as they could tell we were nervous about disturbing other club world passengers. Food good - fresh and tasty. Entertainment not really used due to entertaining daughter! Left and arrived on time - BA lounge Gatwick fine but thought was a bit small. Bought 2 return flights and baby seat for under £3k in BA sale so good on cost. Well done BA and thank you.
1648,M J Brust (United States) 3rd November 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Took BA flight 289 from LHR to PHX 10/27/2014. Very tired 747 with daily service to PHX. Entertainment system wasn't functioning. Only offer was to move to one row from toilets and a complaint card to fill out. Staff just going through the motions. No more BA for me and changing terminals is a nightmare in LHR and will avoid all costs.
1649,L Channon (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Went to BKK via Heathrow on 26th October. Was all excited to be flying back to Thailand. I know direct flights are better but longer but thought flying with the UK flag carrier I was going to get a good flight. Well to be honest I was disappointed - I was at least expecting to be able to charge a phone onboard only to be told only in business class. Most other airlines have this facility in economy. No menus for food and 2 options and same with breakfast. Drinks were limited to soft and only wine and beer. Inflight entertainment was poor at best and was bored witless with films I have seen before or had no interest in. Even the documentaries were all BBC which were ok. Music was equally lacklustre and limited. Only saving grace was the seat I was in and that was the only positive aspect despite the fact there was a baby crying most of the time. Sorry BA. I was expecting a good experience but felt let down and disappointed.
1650,S Storer (Australia) 28th October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA1445 Edinburgh-London code share onto Lisbon. First leg delayed one and a half hours in Edinburgh with no explanation. Arrived at Heathrow and there was no operator available for the airbridge so sat on the plane for 15 minutes. Traveled onto Lisbon on a TAP code share flight and find our luggage had been left at Heathrow. An appalling example of customer service on every front.
1651,DesBrisay Marlyn (Canada) 28th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flight 103 on October 14. We flew from London to Calgary Alberta - a long cramped ride. It was on the new Dreamliner with very tight seats the people in front had to raise their seats when lunch was served as the trays hit our stomachs! Service almost non-existent even on a 9 hour trip! Beverages served once and then at dinner the cart with wine got two rows before us (row35) and they quickly returned it to the back as they felt they were late with the coffee didn't even ask us whether we would like anything. When the coffee did come it was lukewarm. There was not one good thing about our flight. We will never travel British Airways again.
1652,J Hertz (Denmark) 28th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-GRU B744 First time with BA my experience was great. Seat was very good and comfortable with many adjustments. Great dining options good quality of snacks available throughout the flight. Crew very nice. One thing I did not like was the layout making it difficult for people in the middle to have aisle access when seat were turned into beds. And staring directly into people's faces when the curtain between seats is down can be awkward. Crew didn't care too much about safety issues like seat reclining and window blinds for takeoff and landing. Entertainment was a bit disappointing screens were old and blurry not a big selection.
1653,M Bockstruck (United States) 28th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Traveled with British Airways ORD-LHR last month World Traveller on the way out and Club World on the return. Connected to DSM via American Airlines and could see a marked difference in the level of service as well as the hard product. Flew on a B777 both ways and was impressed with the amount of room both in economy and business. USB ports 1 in economy and 2 in business and large entertainment screens. The food in economy was better than I have had on domestic (US) first class and the pitch was comfortable for my 6'1"" frame. Attentive cabin staff who made sure I was comfortable. Drink service in Club world was excellent a good Rose Cointreau and Tanqueray. Lie flat bed fairly comfortable and was able to sleep for 3-4 hours. Due to changes in travel plans I had to pay a change ticket fee but even with that and the cost to upgrade to Club World I felt that I got more than my money's worth. 1 free checked bag for World Traveller and then 3 free with Club World made navigating the airport a breeze. Will fly British Airways the next chance I get."
1654,K Harrington (United Kingdom) 28th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled to Palma in new BA 'sardine' business class. Uncomfortable seats with Ryanair leg room so knees sticking into passenger in front. Poor service. Despite checking in 90 minutes before departure left 2 bags behind which were not delivered for more than 24 hours later causing misery. Other passengers also shocked at conditions. If this is the new look business class BA then better off with Easyjet or Ryanair much cheaper and service could not be much worse.
1655,A Thompson (United Kingdom) 28th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Gatwick to Marrakech and back. Bag drop was fast premium security slow (not BAs fault). Faultless calm boarding on time and a great flight with good service and refreshments. Return flight bag drop even better departure a little late due to a technical problem the 737s are getting on a bit. Again great inflight service and only a little late. Bags arrived as we got to the belt. Am very glad we chose BA for a 3 hour flight. Really good.
1656,J Smith (Australia) 28th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,We flew London Heathrow to Singapore business class for the first time with BA and was not impressed - the cabin crew did the bare minimum they could get away with and as for the seating arrangement we just could not get our head around it - thank goodness we changed our seats prior to flight - we sat on the 2 outer seats that were ok though a bit narrow - felt so sorry for the people who sat in the middle seats as they had to face strangers on the take off and landing - we fly long haul on this route 4 times a year and can quite honestly say that after our experience with BA we would not wish to fly with them again.
1657,J Hertz (Denmark) 28th October 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,GIG-LHR B773 Newly refurbished cabin. Seats were good and comfortable food was reasonable and entertainment was great HD screen with many options.
1658,E Smyth (United Kingdom) 28th October 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-DEL. RTN Club World. Excellent service on both sectors and found that middle seats are good for companions. I found the rearward seating disconcerting but was otherwise comfortable. Flight crews were excellent. I would agree with aisle passengers that they must find the need to reach across them at service times irritating.
1659,Garreth Elston (Canada) 28th October 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BA from Toronto to New Delhi via London in Premium Economy class in August. First leg was on a 787 plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. Premium Economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad bad design). On board service was very good staff were great food was good. Next leg from London to New Delhi was on a 777 much better in my opinion that the Dreamliner primarily as it has better toilet facilities. Again staff and service were top notch. Our return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff but other than that the seats were OK not excellent but definitely comfortable enough. Considering that I hadn't flown BA for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) I was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. Yes being in Premium Economy helped but I was very satisfied comparing it to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly used. Well done BA you made a trip that we were dreading actually quite a pleasant experience and I'm likely to fly BA again now.
1660,K Lee (Trinidad & Tobago) 22nd October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,I fly the POS to LGW route on a fairly regular basis and the punctuality of the flight is bad. I suffered two 6 hour delays within 5 weeks on this route. The air steward wasn't friendly at all and was borderline aggressive when asking passengers to take a seat when the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on. The inflight entertainment needs updating. The screens are small and the resolution low. The seats were not comfortable either and you can feel every movement of the passenger which is sat behind you whenever they reached for something in the seat pocket.
1661,Suhail Shafi (United States) 22nd October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,I recently flew on British Airways long haul on a flight from Philadelphia to New Delhi havinh not having travelled with British Airway for around a decade. I had been a huge fan of British Airways in the past and was very curious to see how their inflight product and entertainment had changed in that time. I also was curious to see Heathrow's new Terminal 5. British Airway's overall product has improved in that time. On the first leg from Philadelphia to London I was very happy to notice the new seats with excellent comfort with adjustable headrests and new Audio Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment systems. I had been travelling with noise cancelling headphones which made the experience a thoroughly enjoyable one. Inflight entertainment system is sophisticated and I enjoyed their World music section in particular. The Asian vegetarian meals was of a high standard for the most part. My only criticism in this area was that on the second meal (breakfast) we only were served a fruit platter and had to ask for the croissants everyone else were given. In addition I found the chapatis on the Delhi-London sector to be hard as rocks. Otherwise the meals were very good. Terminal 5 is a gem of an airport but the true highlight of the journey was on the London-Philadelphia sector when I had the opportunity to fly on the Dreamliner. The plane is a marvel. The windows are huge dimmable by button too. The bathrooms are larger than usual and the flight was very smooth. Additionally the legroom on the Dreamliner is impressive - an improvement on the B777. And finally a word about the cabin attendants. Their level of friendliness varies from person to person but for the most part they represent the best traditions of British hospitality - informal politeness. All in all I was happy with my BA trip and they continue to perform as one of my favourite airlines.
1662,Andrew Duff (United Kingdom) 22nd October 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-AGP and back. 737-400s on both journeys. These aircraft are looking very tatty now - seats worn cabins grimy and dingy. The 'food' was a soggy half-wrap with a filling-free miniature roll - it was unacceptable on a 2hr45m flight. No choice offered by the cabin crew even though they had 3 options. The claim that their food offering is appropriate to the time of day is hogwash - we were served exactly the same thing at 10.30am on the outbound flight as at midnight on the return. Although we benefited from it on this trip BA need to change their hand luggage policy. There simply isn't space for 150+ passengers to bring 2 bags which caused a lot of angst particularly on the return trip (both flights were completely full). On the upside both flights were on time and the crews were friendly - the return crew dealt well with a potentially disruptive family group.
1663,John Ritchie (United Kingdom) 20th October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,"Aberdeen-Heathrow-Miami and return World Traveller Plus (premium economy). Received a text from BA at 0600 that our 09:30 ABZ-LHR flight had been cancelled which would impact upon the US flight. Phoned the helpline as suggested. Utterly useless options provided by their staff which was weighted towards a ticket refund - no use for a family holiday. Made unsuitable suggestions including can you get to Aberdeen for the 7:30 flight (it was 7am and had now spent 1hr on phone to them). Gave up and just went to the airport. Fortunately BA staff there were excellent and got me on next flight to Heathrow despite breaching their own min of 1 hour requirement for connections. Flight to London was good with good service leather seats. Cabin crew facilitated us getting off plane first and BA staff member met us to get us to next gate ASAP for Miami flight. Service centre useless but face to face staff great. LHR-MIA flight. Aircraft a 747 was old and tatty and WT+ seats were rubbish in comparison to Virgin product that I have experienced. Not that comfortable. Seat back TV is same as economy namely 4"" across tiny but selection was ok and seats are fabric and didn't seem that much better than economy. Food (beef) was outstanding for aircraft food. Staff were pretty good. Aircraft on time. Return journey much the same but staff were better. Conclusion is that face to face staff great food great. But needs a modern fleet - our 747 was really aged and their world traveller plus product needs work with hindsight probably would have just travelled economy as leg room wasn't that much more. If you take a iPad to watch movies and are not tall economy would do the job. Their helpline needs to be addressed. Clue being in the title - HELPline. Would fly BA again but would think about their WT+ option carefully."
1664,D Martin (United Kingdom) 20th October 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-DEN DEN-LHR - always use upper class in VA when I can. This flight reminded me of just why I rarely fly BA. Most of the crew were disinterested. I raised a couple of points but I was told I was wrong both times. Asked for another glass of wine twice with my main the stewardess forgot and denied that I had even asked for one. Food going out was pretty good but coming home just awful. I for one can just not get my head round the seat formation. You stare at some stranger on take off and landing food and drinks for passengers on the inner seats are pushed in front of your face.
1665,James williams (United Kingdom) 20th October 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,I flew one way MCO-LGW 6th October the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations British Airways has lost a customer for life. I requested assistance due to illness which I couldn't have at Orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? When boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because I was young and didn't appear to need assistance. After this I could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if I was ok. The drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. The meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route. When I got to Gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance. Never again BA.
1666,Rita Mullen (United Kingdom) 20th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,First class flight from Toronto on Monday 6th October. The cabin crew were first class food was very good. Smooth flight great takeoff and landing. Would recommend flying with British Airways.
1667,P Oliver (United Kingdom) 20th October 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,"LGW to CMB via MLE and return Sept/Oct 2014. As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary ""A Very British Airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort."
1668,Kathleen Kirby (United Kingdom) 20th October 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from LGW to Catania. Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control. Flights both ways were good and we liked the Pilot pointing out Lake Geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. The return flight back to LGW the Captain was hard to hear and wasn't so interesting. That aside on both journeys we felt well looked after with charming FAs. The food was also good too and we landed on time. Baggage came very quickly at LGW but at Catania airport it was a bit of a carnival! I'm afraid Catania airport is the worst airport I've been through but there you go! I think it is one of the joys of travelling.
1669,Guillaume Christian 20th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,St Lucia to London round trip. Full flight both ways quite unhappy staff on return leg tiny seatback screens and poor selection of entertainment meals satisfactory (taste was ok and enough to fill me up both legs on time but was quite expensive for the service I got. Would fly them again if they are the cheaper option.
1670,J Weber (United States) 12th October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,We flew BA from London to Dulles DC 10/8/2014. Unfortunately we were seated in economy so space was very tight but the staff could not have been anymore accommodating which greatly helped.
1671,J Martin (United Kingdom) 12th October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,"B787. Just returned from a London - Toronto - London flight. BA appear to be proud of their new ""Dreamliner"" but they have scored a real own-goal by cramming 9 seats into each row 3+3+3. The only way this has been achieved is by fitting seats that are far narrower than the norm. We are well used to airlines having unjustifiably uncomfortable seat pitch but this was the first time I have found myself wedged into such a narrow seat - and I am quite slimly-built! Unless BA changes their 787s to a less-cramped layout I will now have no alternative but to make sure I am not flying in a 787 thus often avoiding BA altogether. I will let a BA steward have the last word: ""The first time I sat in one of these seats I could not believe how bad they are"" - and he like me is slim. Come on BA - start having a little regard for your customers' comfort and health."
1672,M Richards (United Kingdom) 12th October 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,I travelled to Hong Kong with British Airways from Heathrow on a 777-200 outbound and one of their new A380's on the way back both in World Traveller. It had been a long time since I had travelled with BA (18 years!) but it was one of my better flying experiences. I didn't know what to expect this time round but the seats had plenty of leg room on the 777 on the way out. I was annoyed as I was told to pull my window blind down as other people were sleeping although I had specifically asked for the window seat for a reason. However the crew were great and asked if I'd like to look out of the window by the jump seat which I did for a good few hours! Not only that the crew called the flight crew and the co-pilot walked to the back of the plane to have a chat with me and gave me a map with all the points of interest highlighted with the times we would be above them! Airlines don't have to spend any money to truly satisfy passengers. The seat on the 777 was quite comfortable and the IFE had plenty of selection. The food was good not dried out and it was tasty. All the toilets were operational and were clean. On the way back I was upstairs on the A380. The aircraft was extremely clean comfortable and the A380 was ever so quiet in all areas of the flight which really surprised me. I really loved the 'seat locker' next to my window seat which easily fitted the contents of my hand luggage. Food was good again and the crew were again amazing allowing me to visit the flight deck after the flight had safely arrived at Heathrow. Toilets were clean and tody and all operational and the IFE was good. Leg room was good. The only thing I would say is that the IFE does take up a lot of space under the seat meaning that hand luggage cannot really be stored there and it can get in the way of your feet.
1673,C Cutts (United Kingdom) 12th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-MXP-LHR. Check in/bag drop at T5 once again very slow appears to be a staff shortage at some times of the day. My FFS allows me to use the lounge so I had time for a quick coffee I like the BA lounges at T5. Boarding on time seat 26A on a A320 seemed new with a nice crew a snack and a drink served. Return check in quick Milan Malpenza Airport is horrible! Managed to find lounge close to B35 limited food but quiet wifi was poor although there is a smoking lounge. Boarding quick seat 19A and another newish A319 full flight snack and drink served crew very chatty early arrival at T5. Good product although I booked on day of travel so a bit expensive.
1674,P Wylie (Australia) 12th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Took 6 BA flights as part of a OneWorld RTW trip. JFK to Berlin via LHR then 4 days later Berlin to MAN via LHR and 6 weeks later Nice to DXB again via LHR. All flights on time all cabin crew polite attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line' but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights. Did not use IFE so unable to give a rating.
1675,Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 8th October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,VIE to LHR - Seats were of the new configuration only 30 inches both in Club and Economy. The seats are very uncomfortable and there is very little room to relax or work if the passenger in front reclines their seat. The new cabin looks very small with the new seats and I would not recommend anyone wanting to work to fly with BA now. The service was not to a good service and when taxiing you could hear passengers telling someone to turn their phone off but no crew moved to find out what was going on they were more concerned in their own conversations. I hasten to add that this is the new cabin crew with the thunderbird hats who are far inferior to the well paid counterparts. BA short hall can now be classified as a Low Cost Carrier now they have lost all sense of customer service & customer needs.
1676,G Gibb (United Kingdom) 8th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,"LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice. I would not trust or travel with them again."
1677,G Boyle (United Kingdom) 8th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,BA92 4/10/14 YYZ-LHR B787 G-ZBJE. If you want to know what Ryanair long haul will be like sit in E on the BA 787. Appalling legroom seat width and non functioning IFE. Gold Card holder flying around 200 trips a year. Absolutely horrendous experience good luck to anyone taking the 12hr+ trip to Chengdu on it! New plane with the smallest seats ever. Many passengers tried to stand the entire trip to avoid the discomfort! If you are anything more than a medium build and have a bum and hips you will have a very uncomfortable flight. I am not one to moan but this is the end for me BA!
1678,Guy Senior (United Kingdom) 8th October 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Very comfortable return flight to Hannover in Club Europe. The A319 appeared to be new good food for a short flight and very good value.
1679,J Hill (United States) 8th October 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Just took British from London to Seattle. Tired airplane. Flew business class. Very basic service. No wifi. Nobody checking to see if you were interested in something to drink. Basic packaged food. Very disappointed.
1680,K Jackson (United Kingdom) 5th October 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew from LGW to PFO and back recently. Plane was old tatty 737 but at least we got the 34"" of legroom which the refitted planes no longer have. Flights were on time both ways food was reasonably good & cabin staff were charming (specially on the outboard flight). I was surprised to find BA no longer has a Club Lounge at Paphos and even more surprised to find that there was a comfortable lounge there that BA Club Europe passengers were unable to use. We were given vouchers as compensation and thought we would at least get a glass of wine and a sandwich - but no. The vouchers were of such low value they could only be redeemed for things like a local beer crisps and chewing gum. Even though the flights were quite good I feel that BA are treating their Club Europe passengers with contempt by denying them any lounge access or reasonable compensation - also by refitting their aircraft to give passengers less seat width and the same legroom as economy. Why pay a premium price for a non premium product?"
1681,Derek Salter (South Africa) 1st October 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,Economy from LAX to CPT via LHR. Airbus 380 on first leg 747 on second. Both flights completely full. Airbus quiet - on upper deck with a window seat. Room underseat very limited due to two entertainment boxes but storage by window as compensation. For a new plane seat isn't very comfortable - rather hard and I prefer the old-style head rest on the 747s. Great entertainment screen. 747 seat v comfortable and softer but plane is showing its age and noisy after a 380 flight and the seat back screens smaller than many phones these days. Staff on 380 v helpful and pleasant - more functional on the CPT leg. Special meal not provided on last section of CPT leg - otherwise provided and edible. Boarding easy at LAX more chaotic with less waiting area space at Heathrow - they really didn't plan the waiting areas well at Heathrow - just too cramped and poor layout. And transferring through from section c to section a and then back to section b at Heathrow is a real pain and the shuttle was very full too so would avoid if possible. Otherwise flights on time at both destinations despite leaving late. Heathrow is the main drawback when using BA and transferring - what a shame that they didn't make it easier when planning the new terminal. LAX was a joy to use in comparison - so smooth and staff extremely pleasant and helpful despite having a poor reputation.
1682,Christopher Neep (United Kingdom) 1st October 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,BA 084. YVR to LHR on August 28 2014. Premium economy. Much below previous experiences flying in this cabin on BA. Staff were indifferent and inattentive. The meals were deplorable! Despite being a small cabin there was only one meal choice left half way through the dinner service - a very heavy and overly rich pasta dish accompanied by an equally heavy piece of dry chocolate cake. Hardly suitable food for a long flight. Breakfast was worse - an equally heavy fruit muffin and tea or coffee. Very poor! A number of seats in this cabin have metal boxes underneath rendering the much-advertised additional leg room useless. IFE far below what it used to be in terms of quality and variety of programming. A very unpleasant experience and definitely not worth the additional cost.
1683,D Taylor (United Kingdom) 1st October 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,LHR to Amman Jordan Airbus 321. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to unloading a bag and technical problems on the ground. Flight completely full upgraded to Club World. Cabin crew there excellent and attentive. Seat comfort was OK but not special. Food was good. One very small toilet next to the pilot door for Club World passengers. Terminal 1 on its last legs but check in was quick. Return trip was in Economy-what a difference!
1684,A Cork (United Kingdom) 1st October 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-FCO. Flew out Club Europe courtesy of a reduced fare by BA. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The Lounge in the satellite was more relaxed than the main T5 terminal. As it was an early flight the food was fresh pastries and small bacon baguettes which were excellent. Nice way to start a journey. The flight was good. Very attentive staff on the B767. My colleagues had recently flown easyjet and hadn't flown Club before and were very complimentary about the experience. The return was economy on a new A320. Impressed with the new style seats and again was a good experience.
1685,Ash David (United Kingdom) 1st October 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew BA055 LHR to JNB on the new A380. What an absolute pleasure that was. Had seat 50H which was at front on top deck. The cabin was nicely laid out I have to say I like the BA ""cocoons"" I know a lot of people do not but gave me plenty of privacy. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive with high quality food and excellent champagnes and wines. I would fly this plane again over any other. What was also amazing was a toilet that was not a rabbit hutch. Flew Back on BA056 3 weeks later. Same seat only to find that the seat function did not work New plane and breaking already! Not a major problem as stewards moved the seat manually for me. The quality of the food and beverages was up to the same high standard as when I flew out. Movie choices were excellent and the quality of the new screens way above those on the older 747's and 777's. I managed to get good sleep on both legs at least 7 hours."
1686,Mark Niall (Australia) 1st October 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew earlier this month LHR to IST in Club Europe. Good smooth uneventful trip. Good lounge at Terminal 5. Food and service onboard was very good. Priority boarding and priority pass for immigration in Turkey. However it is difficult to categorise the seating and space with Business Class. In fact the amount of room available seemed little different to Economy.
1687,D Taylor (United Kingdom) 1st October 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Airbus 321 from Amman Jordan to London. Flight on time. Full plane. Very uncomfortable seats I am tall no leg room knees against the seat in front for the flight of over 5 hrs. This is the wrong plane for this trip-narrow single aisle only 2 toilets for all 180 passengers - more like a bucket and spade flight. Food very moderate salad starter of 3 leaves and an uncut chunk of cucumber main course of chicken and potato was tepid not hot at all. Cabin crew spent a lot of the time chatting in the galley at the back of the plane although the food service was quick. Upgraded on the outward trip-what a difference! BA needs to sort the plane choice out-this flight is often completely full. Economy was very poor.
1688,A Cotrim (Portugal) 1st October 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-JNB (South Africa). Booking done from site www.britishairways.com and the check-in too. The time boarding was done with great quality in Terminal 5 in Heathrow airport (pier C gate 65) and schedule. Cabin crew was fantastic. The flight was very good the quality of the plane provides an excellent trip. Takeoff and landing very smooth. The ""rest position"" of the seats makes in upper deck the legroom a little tight. Do not choose the emergency exit seats because they do not have access to windows and are narrower because the table and the monitor are on the armrest. JNB-LHR. 747-400. It is a much older plane. However the trip was very good after crossing the storm just outside Johannesburg."
1689,Driscoll Peter (United Kingdom) 28th September 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"LGW to Alicante out on 8th September early flight. I was disappointed that due to BA changing the aircraft the seat in the exit row that I booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. The seat allocated on the Boeing was quite cramped for my frame and I was not that comfortable. I had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all I got was a request to phone BA after the flight. There must have been other passengers affected in this change. That said the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. Staff attentive and pleasant. The return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as I had requested. The snack was fine and the small bottle of Pinotage was pleasant enough. Due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. I think that BA needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair seem to be able to do. However by booking early I got a great price decent luggage allowance and a snack so I can't complain. I also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines. I do like to ""fly the flag"" and shall continue to do so but a bit of investment in new planes would be nice."
1690,Akram EL Dimerdash (Egypt) 22nd September 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,BHD-LHR. I flew BA from Belfast George Best Airport to London the flight was very good and on time and uneventful. The crew was excellent and the aircraft was a new A319. The fare was ok.
1691,J Rose (United Kingdom) 22nd September 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Considering our outbound flight to Orlando was delayed a good 2 hours I'm not sure why I expected better service from BA coming home. Over a day before our return flight was due there was already a delay posted bumping our flight up a whole three hours. The next morning we wake to find our flight now leaves at the break of the next day at half 12 in the evening! We booked our flight to leave Saturday so we would arrive home on Sunday and be able to go back to work for the Monday. But thanks to the reliability of British Airways not only had we paid for two - now immensely - overpriced flights we will be loosing money from not being able to attend our jobs! Absolutely disgusting show from BA I honestly wouldn't even chance a brief flight with them for fear of having to cancel numerous plans due to the ineptitude of a shoddily run business! I won't be recommending BA in fact I will actively encourage everyone I meet to avoid their awful business at all costs!
1692,N Williams (United Kingdom) 22nd September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-SIN in Economy. Very relaxed and prompt check in at T5. A good attentive and humorous cabin crew nice wine dinner enjoyable the same poor breakfast as 20 years ago. Very clean and tidy interior on 777. Punctual and it goes without saying that the flight crew are excellent and you feel safe. Will definitely seek to use again.
1693,Debbie Donnelly (United Kingdom) 18th September 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Used BA for a return trip to Denver and was very disappointed. Plane was old and tired cabin crew did the minimum required and food was basic. Had flown Emirates the previous month and BA cannot hold a candle to them from the warm towels wide seats great entertainment and shiny new planes. Wont be looking to support BA again.
1694,Neil Macali (United States) 18th September 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Orlando Florida (MCO) - London Gatwick (LGW). Wed Aug 27 return Sun Sep 7. We paid over 150 dollars more for our seats and didn't even get a choice of what we wanted for our meal. In addition the inflight entertainment didn't work on our return trip.
1695,I Cameron (United Kingdom) 18th September 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-LIS in Club Europe (on Avios). Easy check-in and security. BA lounge reasonable - good selection of drinks food slightly stale looking but tasty enough. Bus out to plane. Nice welcome in Club Europe cabin on brand new A320. Seats comfortable albeit less legroom than expected. Food excellent served by very attentive cabin crew. Good updates from pilot. Very good flight overall.
1696,Kuhan Kandiah Chelvanathan (Malaysia) 18th September 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Flew between LHR and JFK and the return leg was IAD to LHR and onward to KUL on MH. I must say BA has an excellent product offering. The crew are extremely friendly and are attentive. They are kept busy the entire flight with juice and water being served consistently. The only setback is that their B747 have seen better days and is in dire need of a refurbishment. Food was good but the IFE could be improved further with enhanced audio and video selection. I will surely fly with BA again. To the crew keep up the good work.
1697,D Preston (United Kingdom) 18th September 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flew Heathrow - Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price. To be honest I have cheaper alternatives from closer airports which I will now be using for my regular flights to and from Spain.
1698,Mark Williams (United Kingdom) 18th September 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR-BUD 11 Sep BA866 and return 15 Sep BA 869 Club Europe. Early morning flight from T3 so breakfast in lounge. Usual assortment of cereals and fruit etc but limited selection of hot food (although the bacon roll was delicious). As is usually the case had to ask for champagne but staff happy to oblige and quickly brought it to our table. Plenty of staff around and the whole lounge appeared to be kept tidy and clean. Had to board via a bus and there was no preference given to business passengers. Managed to get onto the bus first and got to seat without any problem. Plane had been refitted with the new layout. Beautiful cabin and the seats are lovely but gone is the extra leg room in Club. Big disappointment. It feels quite claustrophobic and then the person in front puts their seat back. Not as nice a place to be compared to the old club section aesthetics notwithstanding. Friendly crew plenty of champagne and a surprisingly good hot breakfast of omelette mushrooms bacon and sausage with hot bread. Coffee still poor however. No IFE apart from progress maps / information on small screen from ceiling. BUD airport a disaster. No time at all to clear immigration but had to wait almost an hour for bags - priority tags didn't seem to make any difference. No aircon in bag collection and overcrowded with people waiting for bags. Very uncomfortable and unpleasant. On return the lounge BA shares at BUD is small with very limited selection of food and drinks but all quite acceptable. A short delay was posted at check in and gate changed but all in all no real problem. Priority boarding worked well. Same plane configuration on return. Excellent crew up front on return too - plenty of smiles and chat. FAs free with the booze and nuts. Food was again a surprise - I had cod with a tandoori sauce and rice with cauliflower. Very tasty. BA can be hit and miss but I thoroughly enjoyed both flights. A great soft product if they can maintain the standard but the new fit out is a disappointment.
1699,Mairead Fitzgerald (United Kingdom) 17th September 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,My British Airways experience LHR to Paris CDG was excellent. I was travelling with an infant. The staff at LHR were so helpful and kind and went out of their way to help me. However it was a very different story on the way back. Everyone in Paris CDG was so rude. BA made me check-in my pushchair which meant I had to carry a 14month old boy (15kg) to the gate. It made my trip impossible. I pleaded with the man at check-in. There was no pre- boarding with infants. I will be taking the Eurostar never flying again especially not to Paris.
1700,M Ryan (Ireland) 14th September 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,First and last time flying with BA upgraded the 4 of us to Premium Economy at £199 each for 4 of us a complete waste of money. Have done this with Virgin on occasions for long haul flights and its so worth the money and not as expensive. Food terrible crew and staff not friendly no drinks offered only when handing out food. None of us could eat the food it was so bad. On a 9 hour flight we were hungry. Don't waste your money upgrading I wish I had read reviews before I left.
1701,Julie Jacoby (Australia) 14th September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew SYD-SIN and had a reasonably comfortable trip. Problem is I didn't see much of the staff in premium economy and they were not very smiley either harassed looking. Service definitely down none of the goodies you used to get like snacks and plenty of water. Everyone rather terse I thought and not helpful. Not my favourite to fly. The aisle and seat space are for pixies not real people.
1702,J Henson (United Kingdom) 14th September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Madrid-London on 9 September on Boeing 767 aircraft. No queue at check-in and welcoming polite and efficient agent. Priority tag applied to suitcase. Lounge experience at Barajas Terminal 4 was generally positive. Plenty of places to sit and relax; good selection of food and drinks with sandwiches some hot food ice cream fruit and a full bar. Priority boarding line worked well for business/status passengers. My main gripes are: old aircraft fairly surly crew and a consistent inability to monitor hand luggage (I saw several cases that were larger than the bag I checked in being forced into the overhead lockers). I was in seat 27A which as an exit row seat had plenty of leg room. Full bar service and a chicken tikka flatbread (and vegetarian equivalent) offered. Arrived at Terminal 5B. Bags arrived with minimal (less than 5 minute wait). Overall a decent experience - I will continue to fly with BA provided seats are available at a good price.
1703,Paula Loguda (United States) 14th September 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,9/8/14 LHR-EWR in WC. Clean aircraft but moderate dysfunction of armrest foot stool and video screen. We find this seating configuration very uncomfortable and will avoid BA when possible. One FA spent this flight chatting w. friend to the blockage of aisle and detriment of service. Dinner was fairly horrid (beef) except for salad and cheese. Late departure and 40 min late arrival with no explanations given.
1704,C Kay (United Kingdom) 9th September 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-MCT-LHR. Excellent outbound flight. Tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isn't up to much in terms of choice. Different story on the way back though. Stand-offish cabin crew and no white champagne. Rose only as ""we haven't been fully catered"". Not a big thing but indicative of how slip shod BA can sometimes be these days. The seat is comfortable so I slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink."
1705,B Soleymani (Canada) 9th September 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled YYZ-LHR-ARN and return in mid August. Check in at Pearson was a bit delayed (only one counter open 2-3 hrs before departure although it is advised that passengers arrive that early). Premium economy cabin inside the Boeing 787 (Dreamliner) is very pleasant and the flight from Toronto to London was very comfortable. Transfer at LHR T5 takes time is something I learned on this trip. 1hr connection is for sure pushing it and you're likely to miss your onward connection with anything less than 1.5 hrs transfer time. We missed our connection to ARN (our connection was only 1hr) because of the long line ups at the transfer centre. The fact that you go through security again in LHR takes some time as well. On my way back to Toronto check in at Stockholm's Arlanda Airport was easy and very smooth. The flight to LHR went fine and I had to spend almost an hour lining up at transfer centre going through security. This is the part of the transfer that for sure takes time. After a train ride to the C gates and a fairly smooth boarding I was onboard the flight to Toronto. I had been upgraded to Business class which was pleasant. Service onboard was professional and courteous. Landing in Toronto was a bit delayed due delayed take off from Heathrow. My overall w BA was good. However transfer in LHR is probably one of the more lengthier ones in Europe I think. I preferred the short transfer at KEF on my last trip to Sweden a few months ago.
1706,Mitchell Stephen (United Kingdom) 9th September 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BA 215 LHR-BOS in economy on an ageing 747. Flight was 45 minutes late taking off. Seat was uncomfortable and cramped.Meal served was overcooked slop. IFE had glitches but worked eventually. Overhead light didn't work. The larger people become and they are the less space BA seems to give anyone. The plus point was the politeness and professionalism of the cabin staff.
1707,J Wallace (United Kingdom) 9th September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LHR - IST. T5 efficient as usual no queues at check in or security. Proceeded to the lounge where we relaxed and watched planes take off with glass of champagne. Boarded on time cabin crew friendly food was excellent and of course more champagne! The only thing that BA need to do (which I believe they are). Is to retire these old aircraft. The overall product is excellent but I think the cabin crew are let down by the ageing planes. (IFE not personal to you etc).
1708,S Parikh (United Kingdom) 9th September 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Just came back this morning on a flight from Dubai - BA106. I was not impressed. The cabin crew were just not friendly or helpful. The plane was very old and so were the crew tired and old. It look like they had just got the bad bunch of hostesses to manage this flight. BA was so particular before what's happened? The cabin was very hot and several times my wife asked about it and she was just ignored. The food was very quickly given out many of times people were missed. I have to ask for water a number of times. There was no genuine warmth. It was really like flying on a 3 class air lines. I'd love to fly BA and support them but this is appalling. I would not recommended this - Next time we are flying eremites. Pay the extra. BTW I noticed a number of other people have complained about this crew on the site too - seems consistently bad.
1709,J Tydeman (United Kingdom) 9th September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew Heathrow to Lyon return. Late flight on the way out but made up all but 10 mins of the time. Catering hardly worth the effort as comprised unappetising looking sandwich and one drink (not even tea or coffee on the outbound). Crew good and check in very good especially at Heathrow.
1710,Lianne Weidmann (United Kingdom) 6th September 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,We flew indirect to Orlando and back - although the Miami/Orlando Orlando/Dallas and Dallas/London flights were with American Airlines (BA partners). The BA flight BA0209 was an old plane - the staff were great and food alright but the inflight entertainment was poor. Your own screen but no control over the films which all ran at different times. Having only flown Virgin and Singapore long haul BA rated way behind in all aspects. But that was nothing compared to the 737-300 we flew on with American Airlines from Dallas to London (BA 1531). I understand they are upgrading their fleet and I can see why having flown on the old plane we were unfortunate enough to fly on. The first 20 mins the plane stank like a toilet to the extent that the level of complaints and people standing in protest delayed take off. The inflight entertainment was a joke - a poor quality shared screen with 30 others two films and no choice. The crew were the unfriendliest I have ever encountered - no meet and greet or goodbyes. I thought booking through BA would ensure some level of quality and that they would demand a certain level of quality from their partners but unfortunately not. The worst flight ever (we are a family of five) and I will not be flying BA again.
1711,A Hickling (United Kingdom) 6th September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-PHL on a 787 Dreamliner seat 3K. I recommend seats 3K 3A 7A and 7K as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb over your feet when they leave their seat. The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. The service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better. The aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the conventional blind.
1712,Paul Ingram (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic. I know BA have monopoly on the direct route from Gatwick to Male but I will be going via Dubai on Emirates in future."
1713,R Tompkins (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Boston return. Very quick check-in at Heathrow let down by slow fast track (but that's the airports fault). B gate lounge quiet nice refreshments-I don't think the children's games consoles have worked in the entire time T5 has been open. Short walk to boarding full plane left slightly early landed well ahead of schedule. Crew excellent worked hard throughout. Decent food as well (again). Entertainment out on new system good older system back not as good and screen not in best order. Return flight same comments pretty much except my wife's video system didn't work on way back so they just let her sit in first!. Keep it up BA.
1714,W Simpson (Thailand) 1st September 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,"BKK-LHR-EDI-LHR-BKK Outbound flight up to standard but not above and beyond but this is standard in BA which cannot compare with the top tier airlines. Return flights similar. Faults lay in ground services at EDI and T5 in LHR the latter overcrowded and rather scruffy. Return flight had no magazines (""they forgot to load"") or individual bottled water (""they forgot to load""). Have a need to return to UK so will try an alternative (which is a night flight). Why did BA stop night flights last autumn?"
1715,Debbie Nicol (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-MCO-LGW 11-25th August Economy Class. Got to the gate lounge to be told our seats has been reallocated to another seat this was the reason why - it was because there was a big family party that didn't want to separate - considering I paid a lot of money for my family to sit all together. Got on to the plane thinking it would be the same as Virgin Atlantic but no it wasn't it was an old plane tatty one as well. Food and drinks were limited on the whole 9 hour flight no snacks on board. The food was limited and when we got ours the people in front decide to recline there chairs in front so within that we have told hold our dinners luckily we didn't get burnt. Well sorry BA next time I am flying with VA!
1716,L Gainsford (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-Faro return 19th/26th Aug Economy 2 adults 2 children. Whole experience from Check In to arrival in Faro outstanding. As a regular traveller on this route have now got used to the ex BMI airbuses on this route the seating is perfectly comfortable despite the reduced seat pitch and have never had any problems when requesting more than one drink during the flight. The crew were fantastic in both directions and were totally service orientated from start to finish. Only one minor issue and that is the only one toilet at the rear for the whole economy cabin!
1717,Saagar Chohan (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,"I have flown twice with BA now in business class (to and from Delhi) and I have to say it has been absolutely poor! Me and a few colleagues flew out to New Delhi for a business trip. BA were the pioneers of aircraft's after all they did create The Concorde. Key word in that is ""were"" they've basically turned into a no frills airline. Allow me to explain: The blue worn carpets padded fabric seats with stains worn out grey plastic panels with little grains of grit and dirt get into and a TFT which had the same image quality as VHS tape! The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special. Normally its the little things that make the differences but with BA they need a total make over. For a flight that happens everyday from London to Delhi BA should be doing more. The decor of the plane matched the experience I got with BA dull. I won't be flying long haul with them again. My advice - avoid BA and before you book your flights have a look online at what other airlines can offer you."
1718,Michael Orr (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from London to Doha on a newly refurbished 777. Smooth ride through airport and pleasant staff on hand to help. Boarding was on time but there was a slight delay which put us back by half an hour and delayed take off. Captain was good at keeping us informed. Cabin Crew friendly enough but seemed tired in their service and no smile. Food was average and not anything to write home about. I felt I had to eat quickly as the flight attendant was waiting for me to finish my last bite with a stern look! Inflight entertainment was excellent and kept me entertained throughout the six hours you have got an array of movies TV games and Music to choose from. Seats were really comfy and I got a good kip. Overall an enjoyable experience and I would definitely fly BA again.
1719,Peter Ford (United Kingdom) 1st September 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,ATL to LHR: Boeing 777 (Economy). I've just returned from a family holiday in the USA and flew BA Economy. The flight was slightly delayed but most of this delay was made up during the journey. Staff were pleasant and the IFE was fine. However the food was terrible. Main meal was a choice of Chicken Curry and Rice or a Veggie Pasta. Breakfast before landing was a cold box consisting of a Croissant bag of Cranberries and a Granola Bar. What has happened to the 2 meat choices? (Veggies choose veggie option in advance) and a cooked breakfast? BA have a British flag on the tail but do not serve any British food. I'm a Silver Executive Club member and food on BA has been deteriorating over the last couple of years. I've made several complaints.
1720,A Razak (United Kingdom) 28th August 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,BA12 15th August 2014. In my mind that when I bought the BA tickets it would be a great flight experience based on their reputation as a 4 star airline. It turned out to be totally wrong. I used to travel with other airlines it seems that my flight experience with BA from Changi Airport to Heathrow was the worst in so many ways. Not worth money spent at all! Firstly the seat space was really small (I cant imagine those who are bigger than I am because I am a medium size person). Secondly the proportion of food served was not generous in comparison to other airlines. They only served food twice for that 12 hour long haul journey. Thirdly the service was considered moderate and it seemed like no one cared about the toilets in economy class (no one bothered to top up the toilet rolls). Lastly the inflight entertainment was so back dated. The movies selection must have been 2 years old. Flimsy earphones and outdated screens. All in all an unhappy customer.
1721,Alan Thompson (United Kingdom) 28th August 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,Bari to Gatwick. This flight seems to be late on a regular basis. Three times an hour late and once two hours late this summer of the four times I was involved. Seems the summer schedule is very optimistic Check-in at Bari is hopeless always queues and 'bag drop' seems to be used by travellers with ticketing problems. Boarding is poor regularly left to wait in a hot air bridge between the gate and the plane. None of this done by BA staff but they are doing BA's reputation no good seemingly using the level of service expected with the low cost carriers that also go to London. Onboard though is always good despite the age of the planes. Fair choice of drinks and a good sandwich nice crew. My flight ended with a 50 minute wait for luggage. A lot for BA to address here.
1722,B Wijesinghe (United States) 26th August 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,"DXB-LHR B777-200ER BA0108 August 18 First Class. Transferred from an Emirates flight in DXB. BA DXB Galleries Lounge reception staff member excellent. Boarding reasonable with an on-time departure. Cabin crew outstanding and definitely lived up to the ""To Fly. To Serve"" BA slogan. Food tasty and well presented but not quite First Class and cost-cutting was evident. The New First seat is comfortable though the footrest is poorly designed and a storage area for small inflight items is missing. IFE monitor controls and selection very good but the screen could be more adjustable for reach. Lovely cabin ambience including colors textures mood lighting and window blinds. Toilets cramped and stocked with the cheapest liquid soaps and toilet paper. Overall an enjoyable flight but as a longstanding and very loyal BA customer (Gold Tier) I ask that they seriously consider improving their product in an increasingly competitive market. Arrived a little late at LHR with remote stand disembarking and bus transfer to T5."
1723,R Vines (United Kingdom) 26th August 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,I flew from Gatwick to Rome and back on holiday and was pleasantly surprised by the standard of food and service. The salad on the outward flight was exceptional and the steward on the return leg (in a near-full cabin) was anticipating what passengers might want. BA food baffles me. I've flown First a few times in the past few years and the food was so bad I thought BA should pay compensation as well as refunding the flight ticket. In Business it is usually OK. The only letdown this time was the lounge at Gatwick. It was like a Ryanair holding pen.
1724,David Paton (United Kingdom) 26th August 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,On 28th July flew from Edinburgh to Gatwick. Flight was delayed 3 hours as it had been hit by lightening on the flight this we accepted but what happened afterwards means I will never use them again. 1) Information or details of what was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2) At no time was any refreshment offered. 3) The flight was further delayed to allow people to transfer back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight rather than wait to see what was happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4) No breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5) Although they stated we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service was provided this consisted of 4 fluid oz cup of water between 7.00am and 2.30pm. 6) They then proceeded to leave our luggage at Edinburgh while we travelled to Gatwick. 7) After giving us the run around for an hour and a half they then decided to tell us they could not track our bags. 8) It then took them two days to locate them and send them from Edinburgh to Gatwick. Would I use again or recommend - never in a month of Sundays.
1725,P Priyanu (Germany) 26th August 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,I flew from Munich to Boston via Heathrow T5 (15 August 2014): Munich to Heathrow first flight out of Munich at 7.20. The flight was good leaving on time but due to flight delayed arriving from London the night before so we did not get breakfast served on business class. From Heathrow T5 to Boston as the flight was nice but the business seat was OK nothing special in comparison to other Airline like Iberia business which is much nicer. The cabin crew was nice and friendly food was nice as I have selected to have only salad instead of hot meal. I managed to have a good rest all the way to Boston after the meal.
1726,Chander Ahluwalia (United States) 26th August 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-EWR Club World. Offered 400 GBP upgrade from Prem Econ a day prior. T5 lounge experience positive - good selection of food which was well labelled. Had a treatment - chair massage and Elemis staff were most attentive. Dreamliner is a great way to fly - although delayed half an hour arrived ahead of time. Felt relaxed - addressed by name throughout and the crew was friendly and yes smiled. Two hot towel services and the multi course dinner was served without fuss. Not sure about the wash bag- although it is more convenient to carry off. Entertainment options are excellent. Baggage waiting for me at carousel. Good flight for BA.
1727,Ravi Mene (United Kingdom) 26th August 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,BA 56 JNB-LHR 15 August 2014 Business class A380 upper deck. The flight did not live up to expectations. Too many seats makes business class cabin look crowded narrow seats with each row facing in opposite direction no problem with this but this impedes free movement for some of the seats specially the ones in the middle and window side also not much space for storage of personal items like specs etc. The window blinds of this section in upper deck were kept lowered through the entire 11 hr flight with no cue of any outside light whatsoever until we landed at Heathrow and parked to the stand felt like sitting in a light proof box with artificial illumination. I thought you need to keep the blinds open for landing and take off? The 747 business class is more comfortable than A380.
1728,Jill Young (United Kingdom) 26th August 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,We paid £2500 to upgrade to world traveller plus when we got to departure lounge we were upgraded to business class which was brilliant but air hostess made a point of letting us known plus other people that we had a free upgrade. On the return journey in world traveller plus not happy table broken and air steward very sarcastic food very bad plus stewards seemed as if they were doing you a favour. Paid a lot of money to fly to Maldives have no choice to fly BA to go direct stewards male or female need to remember that we are customers paying a lot of money for a service.
1729,Marie Thompson (United Kingdom) 20th August 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,18 August 2014 Gatwick to Orlando flight details and departure went well. However when the food was served on the flight there was limited choice chicken or sausages which was fine until they ran out and then could only offer the veggie option which was pasta which my Father in Law doesn't eat so he ended up with 2 bread rolls as his lunch/dinner. This was served within the first hour of our over 8 hour flight and then 7 hours later we were served a snack which only had one option coronation chicken (chicken again!) which only 2 in our party of 6 liked. Again my Father in Law had nothing as he was 1 of the 4. Pretty poor show British Airways as we travelled with Virgin to Mexico in June this year economy class and they offered a menu with three choices for lunch/dinner with enough for everyone! Again when the snack was served option were given and enough for all. Virgin also provided a very good entertainment system with up to date films TV and games which was something you need on a long journey again BA was not able to provide. BA your competitors are definitely offering more value for our money! I wouldn't not fly BA again as I don't like to limit my choices however I would definitely prefer to fly Virgin in future. In my opinion all flights should have enough food for all of their passengers and look at what they are offering as coronation chicken didn't go down well with a large number of passengers what's happened to good old ham or cheese?
1730,C Kay (United Kingdom) 13th August 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,LHR - Houston - LHR. Two of us travelled using Avios and Amex companion voucher. Excellent cabin crew on both sectors very good selection of wine and food pretty decent particularly outbound. The staff in Houston even found and returned my iPod which I had left on the aircraft on the outbound sector.
1731,Commins Susan (Ireland) 13th August 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,I was on BA 835 from Dublin to LHR on 25th July 2014 which left Dublin at 13.05 and my travel plans were such that I had sufficient time to connect with my flight from LHR to Hong Kong. On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that BA appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings. Could do a lot better!
1732,Buettner Thomas (Germany) 13th August 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA 937 Dusseldorf to London on 13th March and BA 932 back to Dusseldorf on 15th March. Both flights served by Airbus A319. Cabin was in a good shape seat pitch 34 inch and the width 17 inch. Lounge in DUS (Airport owned Lounge) is quite nice but nothing special Lounge of BA in LHR T5 is very good with a lot of space even it was very busy at this time but anyway we know it from other times when it was quite empty. No check-in because of hand luggage only. BA 937 was delayed for about 1 hour due to foggy weather in London so the very nice staff start to serve Drinks to reduce the waiting time on ground. Brunch served after takeoff a choice between a cold platter with assorted cheese and meat and bread/rolls or a warm cheese and ham croissant and salad. Drinks including Champagne were served twice. More enough for that relatively short flight. Check-in for BA 932 (bought liquids) in T5 was very quick also friendly staff. BA Lounge as I wrote was busy but worth it to reduce waiting time. Very nice flight attendants drinks served 3 times light Dinner with mixed salad. No real Inflight Entertainment (like on most IntraEuropean Flights) small TV´s with flight information.
1733,Tom Lewis (United Kingdom) 11th August 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled LHR-YYZ BA97 on 9 July returning BA96 28July. Check-in at LHR an absolute breeze including security which took only 5 minutes. Galleries Lounge at the south end of T5 awful with poor food dirty furniture and smelly toilets. Outbound aircraft was G-BNLG surely one of the most ancient 747s in existence judging by the state of the interior at least in the main cabin. On boarding all the window shades were down (10.20 departure) and stayed down for the entire flight including take-off and landing most peculiar. The head cabin service person said it was to keep the sun out - I have questioned if this is a new BA policy for daytime flights. Departed and arrived a few minute late no issue. Food and service very average as usual nowhere near the standards of international Business Class elsewhere. Immigration and baggage delivery in YYZ very swift. For the return again the departure formalities were quick and painless ; the lounge at Pearson is ok but nothing special. Aircraft this time was G-BGYC the upper deck was in reasonable condition although as always with BA's Club World seating there is little stowage space and the whole backwards/forwards concept is something I personally dislike. Food almost non-existent on this 2310 departure and most people slept: this would be understandable if a proper breakfast was on offer. Unfortunately it was no better than going to McDonalds with some unripe fruit and a sort of egg and bacon muffin - just awful. Also the person in the window seat did have something to eat and drink and every time the crew member came with his orders he would lower the partition to pass them through with all the disturbance that creates. Is this service policy poor seat design or lazy crew? Flight on time arrival processes ok but baggage delivery slow. All in all the experience was what I expect from BA these days average at best.
1734,G Fox (United Kingdom) 11th August 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Flight from Heathrow to Newark. The new Dreamliner was fantastic. Very comfortable quiet and clean. The cabin crew were superb very professional with customer service being their priority. I appreciate that flying on a new aircraft makes a difference to the flight however if BA continue to invest in their fleet and maintain and excellent level of customer service I can see no other reason to fly with another carrier especially when considering BA's avios points usage which allows all of your points to be spent on flights. Virgin however dictate how many points you can spend on each flight. I've flown with BA and Virgin many times it was a nice attempt by Virgin advertising themselves in terminal 5 however when you're sat in terminal 5 after experiencing a quick and easy run through the terminal about to board a brand new aircraft it's hard to see the advertisements working.
1735,James Keep (United Kingdom) 6th August 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Great service from LCY-Angers in western France on Embraer 175. London City Airport is so very convenient for London dwellers and the flights were very comfortable. Saturday flight outbound was totally full but on time attentive cabin crew very comfortable and not even the breakfast of a disappointingly hard croissant with ham and cheese could spoil the positive impression. Coming back on the Wednesday was less than half-full so double drinks and snacks all round! Tickets were £120 return which seems very reasonable considering the alternative for the region is Ryanair to Tours from Stansted for almost as much and once you factor in the extra price of luggage and snacks with them BA wins hands down.
1736,Graeme Cree (United Kingdom) 6th August 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,06.40 flight 4 August Glasgow to London City cancelled with no explanation. Typical BA service nobody about to assist with alternative arrangements or any concept of customer care. So much for the worlds favourite airline. Third rate which is what I have come to expect from them.
1737,Tony Laverghetta (Canada) 4th August 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LIS-LHR on 30 July J class on an Airbus 320. I was expecting more however I was disappointed. Seat was OK but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor. Cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. No inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. However we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a Business Class seat. Will fly BA again but I am more keen to Intercontinental flights where the quality is superior than European routes.
1738,Tony Hall (Australia) 2nd August 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,AMS-LCY economy. Embraer aircraft only half-full at most and on time. For such a short flight a high standard of cabin service with wine and a small snack offered. An excellent flight in all respects.
1739,Tony Hall (Australia) 2nd August 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Porto-LHR economy. Pushed back late but arrived on time. Flight was full but good cabin service with sandwiches and drinks. A very good standard overall.
1740,Sander van Kan (Netherlands) 29th July 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA935 DUS-LHR on 31/5/2014 onboard G-EUPU (A319). Flight was on time and smooth. A drink was served together with a small sandwich. Crew was good and the seats were also fine for this short flight.
1741,Sander van Kan (Netherlands) 29th July 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA283 LHR-LAX on 31/5/2014 onboard G-XLEE (A380). Flight was punctual and very smooth. A nice breakfast and dinner was served during this flight. We also received an ice cream which was very tasty. Crew was good and friendly. Only drawback are the very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour flight. We were seated on the upper deck on row 74. A very big advantage is that the seating is in a 2-4-2 configuration and the window seats have a very nice 'bin' were you can put all your stuff.
1742,Prasad Chalikonda (United States) 29th July 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Round-trip with family from JFK to HYD via LHR. Onward flight was delayed at JFK by 2 hrs. Was stressful with 10 month old and a 4 yr old. Inflight service was good. Transit at LHR was a nightmare! Mile long walk after alighting to central point in Terminal 5. No gate information anywhere. Had to check-in again they had to scan each and every food item for the baby! Though departing flight was from same Terminal 5 had to now walk 30-40 yards go down a level walk again to train get off second stop go up escalator again and walk another 50 yards to last gate - C63. Now here the gate agent wouldn't let our carry on through. Said it was too big. So had to remove all baby food and items for the kids and carry them in our hands inside the plane and check the carry-on. Return flight again was delayed. Had checked in at 3.30am for 6.40am flight but flight took off at 9.15am. Transit at LHR was thankfully better this time. But the aircraft to JFK was an old 747 - falling apart. No bulkhead this time as original flight was late and they had to accommodate us on another full flight. Old seats kept reclining on its own. A/C was blowing hot and cold until takeoff. Had asked staff to serve meals first to the 4 yr old - no luck. Never going to fly British again or pass through LHR again!
1743,Cutts Craig (United Kingdom) 29th July 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-BSL-LHR 22nd/23rd July BA748 and BA755 A319 each way bag drop at T5 seemed to take ages. Once through used the North lounge which was pretty full at this time of the day. Flight delayed a little and arrived about 15min late service on this 1hr 20min flight was fine for economy class a sandwich and drink supplied return bag drop in Basel quick used the Euro Lounge which was very nice. Return flight quick boarding very full a sandwich and drinks served and again service good for a short flight arrived T5 bit late but bags recovered and out in 30 min.
1744,N Salisbury (United Kingdom) 29th July 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,We flew to Rome from Newcastle via Heathrow the ground staff service was excellent at Heathrow as we needed disability assistance the day before we were due to fly home I received a text at 17.30 to say our flight had been cancelled but could not contact customer services for over 14 hours we were told we had been booked on an earlier flight which meant taking a taxi to the airport losing the money we had already paid for our previous transfer and the disability assistance service we receive in Heathrow was awful. We were left for 1 hour for someone to take us from the plane and then at the next station there was no one to take us to our flight connection so I had to push wheelchair myself.
1745,Sander van Kan (Netherlands) 29th July 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA274 LAS-LHR on 8/6/2014 onboard G-CIVB (B747). Flight was on time and smooth. Catering was very average and small portions. Quality was much less then BA standard. Crew was good but we didn't see them for a very long time during this flight. Only 2 drink rounds were made during this 9.5 hour flight everyone knows that is not enough. Seats were good with just enough legroom.
1746,Alan Skinner (United Kingdom) 29th July 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,BA2262 on 17th Feb 2014. I was in 4A from Jamaica to London Gatwick and no need to climb over anyone’s legs and you're close to the toilet and the galley were your can help yourself. Seat is very good and good space. Great meal I had the Chicken Curry very good and a nice bottle of wine to help it down. The Stewards were very helpful. Going to Grenada soon and see they have first on the flight so going to try that.
1747,A Hickling (United Kingdom) 29th July 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,DME-LHR July 23 Club World seat 64A. It was quite a novelty travelling on a 747 aircraft for a flight just over three hours long. I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing. The food and wine choices were very good and the Club Kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.
1748,A Hickling (United Kingdom) 29th July 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-DME on 19 July seat 1A Club World. I flew on one of the converted A321 jets that BMI used to own and was very impressed with the seat. The configuration is 1 and 2 seats and if you're travelling alone the single seat is great to have. There is lots of space to place items and the seat has different positions from arm chair to fully flat bed. The seat also has a built in massage function. The TV screen was 15 inches in size and operated from a remote in the seat. The service was excellent from two male crew members and the food and wine selection was of a high standard.
1749,E McKerrell (United States) 27th July 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Flew on a 777-200 from London Heathrow to San Diego worst flight I have taken on British Airways. Being a rather tall person 6'7"" and travelling in economy the person in front of me could not recline his seat due to my legs blocking his recline he complained to the cabin personnel that he could not recline and I was asked to remove my knees so he could recline stating to cabin crew that I would not have a comfortable journey they did not seem to care. When the food was served I could not even put my tray table down so the cabin crew would not serve me a meal stating that the tray must be in the down position to eat a meal. So to tell you the truth I spent the best part of 7 hours of a 11 hour flight in the toilet at least in there I could stretch out my legs. Wrote a letter to British Airways to inform them of my flight haven't heard anything back from them. Just shows you they really care about their passengers."
1750,Hannah Shad (Sweden) 17th July 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flew GOT-LHR-LAX and back on the new A380. Flight from GOT-LHR was alright even though the flatbread they served was inedible. Transferred through T5 quick and easy. Must say that Heathrow gets better and better for every time you visit! The long haul flight on BA's A380 was excellent. I was sat on the upper deck which is a huge privilege since the seats are 2-4-2 also I was sat in a window seat which made it all even better since they've installed lockers next to the seats where you can put your stuff. The staff was excellent (and also very good looking) and the food was better than I could've imagined for an economy route. The whole experience was overall better than I'd thought for a 500$ ticket and so far the best I've gone with when it comes to flights over the Atlantic.
1751,D Day (United Kingdom) 17th July 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,"LGW-BGI-LGW Club World R/T. Old careworn B777-200. Airplane was not clean both sectors. Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. Inbound airplane toilets reeked. At least food on return was slightly improved. Cabin Crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. The Club World seats are narrow and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens poor and tiny selection of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. I am amazed that British Airways standards are so low and they get away with it. This is mere A to B transport. What is missing from their Business Class is ""class""."
1752,S Tibble (United Kingdom) 17th July 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,10th July BA117 LHR-JFK. Well I have not flown with BA for a number of years as they are not my favourite airline from past experience. We were travelling with hand luggage so should be easy. Decided to not pre purchase seats but go for online check in and seat selection. All very easy and got good seats on 777-300 should have been 747 but obviously had an aircraft change. So we arrive at airport and go to security and scan our boarding cards get rejected you need to get your passport and visa validated from the BA desk before you can proceed. Would be good if this was shown on boarding pass. Boarding very good onto a new plane good seats good entertainment staff seemed interested and engaging. All the crew seemed very good. I walked off the aircraft with my view of BA restored would I fly again with them yes.
1753,J Norman (United Kingdom) 15th July 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR to Mumbai return with my husband - very disappointing. The Galleries lounge at Terminal 5 was overcrowded noisy and had the feel of a cafeteria not the tranquil haven suggested by BA. The food was below average. Unable to avail ourselves of the spa' facilities as they were fully booked. Not enough toilets for the number of people in the lounge and my husband had to queue! We had to pay extra to guarantee 2 seats together to the tune of £240. When we boarded the aircraft (Boeing 747-400) the cabin crew appeared rushed and flustered they were not forthcoming with drinks or refreshments or particularly welcoming. The 'yin and yang' seat configuration didn't work out well for us as we continually had to lean forward to talk to each other. The seat comfort was okay but quite narrow. My IFE did not work on the return flight. The in-flight food was above average but not outstanding. Check-in at Mumbai for the return flight was very slow. We were kept waiting for at least 40 minutes with no apology for the delay. The business class lounge at Mumbai is appalling cannot be described as business class at all. No facilities the food very poor both in quality and selection and had clearly been hanging around for some time. The whole experience of BA's Club World was seriously underwhelming and we will not fly with them again.
1754,Payne Rob (United Kingdom) 15th July 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-CPH-LHR. Business class on the way out and economy on the return trip. Flight on time on both trips staff as usual excellent both within the airport and on the planes. No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.
1755,D Leston (United Kingdom) 15th July 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-FRA-LHR in spotlessly clean airbuses both looked brand new (although they weren't). Crews were immensely friendly and helpful with a smile for everybody. Slight delay on the return leg but kept well informed. Only minus point is the remote stands at FRA that slow boarding and disembarkation to a snails pace.
1756,G Thompson (South Africa) 15th July 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.
1757,Senden Roswitha (United Kingdom) 15th July 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Very disappointed with my flight back from Munich although it's only 2 hours all that was offered was a small basket consisting of a packet of nuts or shortbread. The flight over to Munich was considerably better being offered chicken curry wrap etc. We were told when booking this return in Munich that there was only one seat left however once in the aircraft there were still seats left including one next to me! However it's really the snack offered that's my main ""bone of contention"" as we chose British Airway in preference to the cheap budget airlines but we now find there's little difference in the on flight catering."
1758,Jackie Craig (Italy) 15th July 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,I flew with British Airways with my mother from Paphos to Manchester. She had a fit to fly certificate that stated that she needed room to turn as she had recently broken her hip. I was told at the airport that there were no seats at the front available so she had to go into the second row and had to shuffle in sideways which was very painful and distressing for her. Then the 3 seats in front of her where she could have had room to turn were occupied by 3 able-bodied men! I think this is total disregard for passenger welfare. I will never fly with BA again.
1759,Harris Lisa (United Kingdom) 13th July 2014,na,British Airways customer review,Just taken a BA flight LHR-JFK rtn. Outstanding service staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable. The cabin director found out it was my Dad's 60th birthday and gave him a bottle of champagne to take away. Very friendly and nothing too much trouble. We flew on older 747 and newer 777 with latest interior - both very comfortable plenty of leg room and entertainment great. Screen on older aircraft a little small but much better on newer. Food was the best I had on any airline. Restaurant quality without a doubt.
1760,John Frewen-Lord (United Kingdom) 6th July 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from LHR to YYZ on 23 June on new 787. Not impressed. Very bumpy taxiing. Smooth inflight but I couldn't really notice the extra cabin pressure or humidity that is supposed to be so wonderful. I was seated in a window seat. Flight completely spoilt by massive 130 kg passenger seated in middle seat - he could not fit between the armrests and needed help from both myself and passenger in aisle seat to even fasten his seatbelt. This is unacceptable especially since I paid £30 extra to choose my seat! Cabin crew friendly and efficient though why they didn't notice the situation with my huge fellow passenger and do something about it I don't know - safety issue if nothing else. Otherwise flight OK.
1761,J Kain (United Kingdom) 6th July 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,Flying from Aberdeen to Toronto via LHR. On board the new 787s on this route you can really notice the difference that they make over the 777. No drying of the eyes or popping of the ears thanks to the good air system. Although a little cramped in economy on the outbound journey I was able to secure a bulkhead seat on the overnight back. I would definitely recommend this as value for money over eco+. Just buy the economy ticket and pay to have a front row seat (there is more leg room and the same service from what I saw). The small commuter plane from ABZ to LHR and back was starting to feel pretty old and tired by comparison to the 787 however the cabin crew did a great job shoehorning in a full meal service in less than an hour.
1762,Colin Pay (United Kingdom) 6th July 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-JER return. Out on B737 back on A319 both flights almost full.80 minute delay leaving Gatwick due to French ATC strike not airlines fault. Going out no problems hand baggage only checked in online. Return a different matter unable to check in online and no self service machines at Jersey Flybe have at least six. Check in opened over half an hour after stated time when a sullen agent appeared eating an apple and carrying a newspaper. She then managed to seat by wife and I in middle seats in different rows. Customer service at Jersey shows B.A. in a bad light. The flights were fine beer and snack both ways on a 30 minute leg.
1763,Jonathan Rodden (United Kingdom) 6th July 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,Flew BA 025 Heathrow to Hong Kong in First Class seated in 1A July 2nd 2014. Great flight great service and cabin crew were excellent. I have flown this sector many times and this is one of best flights that I have had on BA.
1764,Ryan Thomas (Australia) 6th July 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled from OZ to watch start of TDF in Leeds. BA cancelled 7.20am flight 1340 5/7 the day before due to staff issues and changed me to a 13.50 flight and then expected me to get on the 15.30 same day return to London. Very poor and lame excuse. To make matters worse will not refund return flight of same day as on separate booking. Amazed such a big airline can't manage something as simple as staff rosters to ensure customers could get to Leeds to see the start of the 2014 TDF. What a disaster.
1765,Alyssa Ablitt (Australia) 6th July 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled with my husband sister and brother inlaw to Rome via Heathrow. Yep long flight so everyone kept reminding me when I told them where we were from. Decided to upgrade to Premium Economy and thanks to our travel agent got a good deal. Several years ago I was put off from flying British Airways so thought I'd give them another go. Wasn't disappointed all flights were good considering we flew straight through to Rome I felt pretty good at the end of 30 hours in the air. The Premium Eco seats had plenty of leg room on all flights 2 bags per person even the flight from Barcelona to Gatwick which we were very grateful for. Can't say the food was anything to rave about. When the food you are eating has been on the plane as long as you have it really can't be good. Overall the flights were really good on time easy pickup of bags etc. the only disappointment is having to pay for the allocation of our seats. Apparently this is now common practice. Just be upfront about it that's all. will defiantly investigate BA again though.
1766,John Frewen-Lord (United Kingdom) 6th July 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flew YYZ to LHR on 1st July. Booked WT+ but was upgraded to Club World at the gate which went some way to compensate for the awful outgoing flight (see separate review). Fabulous flight very attentive flight attendants decent food (although the cannelloni was a bit dry) excellent wine Only slight negative was that the 777 is a noisy aircraft even sitting near the front. Overall this was BA at its best.
1767,Luke Toornent (Netherlands) 1st July 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,I flew AMS-LGW-MCO and JFK-LHR-AMS this month. Overall is was an acceptable experience. Food and drinks the normal airline stuff. Staff were good and visited us often. I only found the seats very unpleasant.
1768,Jeff Smith (United Kingdom) 30th June 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,Flew LHR to Larnaca and return 22nd April and 29th April in Club Europe. I had high hopes for Business class albeit shortish haul but was somewhat disappointed. Legroom not quite what I expect from Business class 34 inches is hardly room to stretch out. The service was good but the choice of food was limited and again not what I expect from a business class experience. As for inflight entertainment? Oh dear. On a 4.5 hour flight I expect so much better old fashioned one film option only. If you didn't like the film tough. All in all I will not rush to pay the extra.
1769,Tom Adamson (Australia) 30th June 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,"LHR-SEA in ""first"" class. The experience was really a step back in time. Having arrived in London on JAL after an exquisite experience in their 777 first class I had high expectations of my premiere flight in BA first. Suffice to say I won't be back. Whose idea was it to jam 14 seats into a space that quality airlines fill with 6 or 8 seats? It's crowded ugly and lacks privacy. The whole cabin - and this is 'new' first I might add - feels pretty cheap and is already showing signs of wear and tear. The seat itself is narrow and displeasing. Crew were cheerful and professional but the food would be considered business class standard on world class airlines. That sums it up really - BA is simply not offering a world-class product. I can't imagine why anyone would put down the money they charge for first class unless there was no high-profile Asian or Middle Eastern alternative available and even then I'd probably go out of my way to avoid them. I suggest that BA product managers might want to go on a world tour via Abu Dhabi Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore and try out the competition because it's plainly evident that they either have no ideas or just don't care. There is apparently a ""new new"" first class planned for the 787-9 when it enters service with BA and I sincerely hope that both the hard and soft products will be worthy of being branded ""first class""."
1770,Jonathan Rodden (United Kingdom) 25th June 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from LHR to Hong Kong April 13th 2014 BA 25 and the flight took off 1 hour late. Therefore as I had an onwards connection to Jakarta with limited time to get my connection I asked on board about help with getting my onwards boarding card to Jakarta as BA in Belfast refused to issue me a boarding card. The CSD was not seen nor did he even come to speak with me even though I am GGL member. The only help I got was from one of the Hong Kong based air stewardesses who went out of her to help me. Without her help I would have missed my onwards to Jakarta. Certainly not impressed by the service. I made a follow up compliant however never received any response.
1771,Kidd William (United Kingdom) 23rd June 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,I flew from Edinburgh to Heathrow and then on to JFK and returned from Las Vegas. The flights in the UK were fine but the flight to JFK and from Vegas to Heathrow were terrible the seats were narrow and the food was disgusting both ways.
1772,V Bristow (United Kingdom) 23rd June 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,Flight BA 202 Boston to Heathrow. Aircraft B747 version 1. We were seated in PE. The cabin was quiet and not full so we had plenty of room. The cabin crew were very attentive and spoke to all the passengers in our cabin. Service after take off was very quick and professional the food was very good and not hurried giving us 3.5 hours to sleep. The seats were very comfortable and the extra space was appreciated. My only complaint is my TV monitor was faulty and had a black line down the screen. It was not an issue as I was planning to sleep rather than watch a movie. The cabin was quieter than economy as it was at the front of the plane and I had a good 3 hours sleep. The Flight attendants were offering drinks throughout the flight which was good. The breakfast was a croissant in a box which I found a bit of a disappointment. Overall I would fly BA Premium Economy again.
1773,L Bell (United Kingdom) 20th June 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,We travelled Cancun to LGW in business class. To the point I didn't think the experience was as good as Virgin and Emirates who I normally use. Airport staff were helpful although I was surprised there was no lounge access at all ( we got 2x USD 22 vouchers for the restaurants in the airport). Cabin crew were not particularly attentive or helpful. Dinner and wine/drinks were nice although cabin crew had to be prompted to serve drinks again after dinner. Seat and space was ok although functionality on seat not as good as Emirates or Cathay. My friend had no direct access to aisle and had to jump over another passenger's legs. Breakfast was sub standard.
1774,Robert Kovacs (United States) 20th June 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,I was excited to fly on the new A380 with the new seating. We sat in 14j and 14k. When we were seated we were offered champagne and we organized our belongings quickly. I sat down got out my magazine and asked the flight attendant how to operate the light and she apologized that our seats had no power and they have been working on it. Well after about ten minutes the door closed and the plane pushed off and I inquired again about the issue and she said the pilot was working on it. The power never came on during the 10.5 hour flight. We had no lights no entertainment no seat adjustments. I not given the opportunity to deboard when they knew of this problem or to reschedule another flight. This is not how you treat your business club passenger or any passenger. I was told I would be contacted by a representative but that did not happen.
1775,Sears Michael (United Kingdom) 20th June 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Club World–LGW to TPA week later MIA to LHR. Gatwick check in quick and easy BA member came over and pointed us through Fast Track and gave lounge instructions. Lounge food offering very disappointing compared to LHR made do with Marmite on toast and lots of Champagne! In celebratory mood as going for a 30th cabin crew outbound fantastic the drinks kept flowing and never a rolled eye or any surly attitude from the crew. Managed 4/5 hours afternoon nap. Upgraded WTP home bound to CW through AVIOS 24hrs before and even bagged upper deck. An amazing night flight left on time. Have always found UD crew fantastic two pre departure drinks and mixed fleet seemed genuinely flying to serve. Only downside was pretty terrible dinner - starter and salad dreadful steak main not much better. Requested tray be taken away and skip dessert. Reclined and slept - and got woken 6 hours later for a bacon roll. Landed at LHR on time through security four bags collected and out of airport in 25 minutes. Club World and Heathrow fantastic when it goes well. Apart from food and beverage – a definite 10/10. Will be a very sad day when the 747s retire UD on A380 far more cramped.
1776,Mark Gentleman (United Kingdom) 20th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,EDI-LHR-FCO-LHR-EDI. EDI lounge good. Flight to LHR on time food decent attentive crew. North lounge at T5 much better than chaotic South lounge. Flight to FCO by 3 cabin 767 so upgraded using avios - fully flat beds great FA's superb food good wine. Lounge at FCO okay food not great. Flight delayed at FCO due to storms at LHR so ample time to use the flat beds watch a film and relax. FA excellent food very good again. Overall the flights and service were superb.
1777,Donal Ryan (Ireland) 20th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,London Heathrow to Singapore. Brand New 777-300 very comfortable very clean. Entertainment was good and food tasty but very small portions. Staff functional but not friendly only one water run in 13 hours. Arrive early so cant complain. Better than Qantas flight Singapore to Brisbane.
1778,D Remnant (United Kingdom) 17th June 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,London Gatwick to Orlando. No surprises to guess that as our original flight to Tampa was cancelled this is not a good review. Due to a technical problem with our plane our flight was cancelled. After finding out from other passengers in the terminal that our flight was cancelled we were marched back through the airport to queue for our luggage to queue to go back through immigration to queue for our details to be entered onto the BA system for an unexplained reason. What an insult to have to stand in line 3 times for over 3 hours. No extra staff no positive explanations no apologies no customer service only a lie of a promise of a special flight the following day to our original destination (which did not happen) and some inadequate vouchers for food and drinks. After accepting that our flight was cancelled and then accepting the fact we would be travelling the following day BA then just drop an email to all passengers to advise them what arrangements had really been made. Our first arrangement was a flight 24 hours after our original departure time from Heathrow to Charlotte to Tampa. We did not book our direct flight by accident why on earth we would we accept a flight with a stop over. I declined this arrangement for a flight instead to Orlando. A longer busier flight a bigger busier more time consuming airport a 3 hour drive from our holiday destination. We arrived 32 hours later than our original arrival time and therefore lost a day and a half of our holiday. To add further insult on our return flight the extra leg room seats we paid £100 for not allocated to us! Uncomfortable claustrophobic seating cheap microwave style food cheap wine unacceptable and a waste of money.
1779,I Jackson (United Kingdom) 17th June 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Club Europe - supposedly premium - had the misfortune of seat 1f - normally a great seat in Club Europe - but for a 4 hour flight LGW to ACE - cramped (not quite as bad as the rest of CE with new - not advertised - 30 inch rather than 34 inch seat pitch) - no window just a wall. Add to this limited luggage space think its EasyJet with middle seat free for £600 more. Is it worth it - no thinking avoid BA CE offering - shame I've a few flights to suffer yet. Purser - ""this is it now - get used to it"" - service downhill too."
1780,John Pollock (Australia) 13th June 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,BA11 LHR-SIN 11 June. This flight and the reciprocal one from Singapore to London in economy a month ago have restored my faith in BA. The aircraft was clean and in good condition; seats were comfortable staff were unfailingly attentive friendly polite and efficient. Meals were of a good standard toilets were clean and properly maintained throughout the flight. Boarding and disembarking were seamless from BA's side. One of the best flights I have had for years on many different carriers.
1781,Bob Motto (United Kingdom) 13th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,LHR to DXB 11 Jun 14 Club World Upper Deck 64A - Great flight slight delay of ten mins but excellent crew on the upper deck. Food choice is excellent and service as always of a very high standard. Not too sure about the new wash bags large draw string bag with minimal contents the wash bags get bigger but the contents get smaller! Nothing really useful in the wash bag not even eye masks or ear plugs. Useful contents would be mouth wash wet wipes etc it is about time BA looked at returning to Molton Brown which was a lot superior than the Elimis range. Otherwise a great flight met by special services on arrival in DXB who whisked me through Immigration and Customs within 20 mins of landing which exceeded all expectations.
1782,C Edgar (United Kingdom) 13th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Flew from Edinburgh to New York via LHR on 5th and 10 June. All flights were very full but the service from check in to on board were very good. My only complaint was the breakfast on the return flight a croissant jam and tea or coffee which was very disappointing.
1783,Nelson Laura (United Kingdom) 13th June 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Outbound BA 175 12/5/14. Return BA 286 1/6/14. Recently travelled economy on long haul to NYC and returned from San Francisco having previously done long haul with Virgin. BA knocks Virgin into a cocked hat. Love BA. Keep flying the flag!
1784,J Doherty (United Kingdom) 12th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,OSL-LHR June 8th. Two days after arriving I departed still less my check-in bag from June 6th. Flight delayed this is more often than not on most BA flights I have been on. Food offered in economy same Chicken Tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. I would rather have the option to buy something I might want to eat. Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but it's the only reason they have any customers.
1785,V Bristow (United Kingdom) 12th June 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,BA 213 LHR to Boston. T5 was very busy but check in was fast and efficient. The flight was on a 747 the aircraft was clean but looking dated. We were seated to the rear of the aircraft. The food choice was OK but both meals had curried options fine if you like curry but limiting if you don't. Lucky for us there was still a choice. My TV was broken so I had a long 6.5 hours. The flight crew were very helpful and happy.
1786,R Thompson (Canada) 12th June 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Flew World Traveller Plus for the first time. Our trip was to and from LHR from Toronto YYZ. When flying a distance World Traveller Plus is well worth the little extra. Being a big guy - tall - I really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. And the on-board staff were super. Will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. Unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at Heathrow on Friday June 6th. We made it back to Toronto OK but our luggage was just delivered to our house today Wednesday June 11th. I guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. I'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. All-in-all I will definitely fly British Airways again.
1787,Wallace Gordon (United Kingdom) 12th June 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,Glasgow to LHR on a completely full flight. The crew were amazing despite being provoked by an extremely rude lady who was sitting at the emergency exit seat they remained calm and professional despite her rude and obnoxious comments. Departed on time and landed early which is always nice.
1788,Ian Roberts (United Kingdom) 12th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-CPH-LHR both A320s. Other than bussed to stand on the outward all was very good. The bus is unexpected at a 'new' terminal but the warmth of the welcome from the crew cheered you up a lot! Simple and tasty flatbread and drink ideal for the 1.45 journey. The return was a tad delayed due local ATC but even though only 10 mins or so the flight deck kept us very well informed and the crew came round with juice or water. Delay was made up enroute and bag appeared as I reached the carousel. Advance booking and using a few points (some I earned back on this flight) made the fare cheaper than low cost carriers. With BA renewing it's fleet the a/c seemed almost new and all very enjoyable.
1789,J Doherty (United Kingdom) 12th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Rome Fiumicino - LHR Jun 1st Economy Airbus 321. Great staff food offering poor I would have been happy to pay for a better option.
1790,J Rose (Australia) 8th June 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-SIN in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say about this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less. Would not recommend.
1791,Berry Nick (United Kingdom) 8th June 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LHR to BOS. Day after baggage shut down but First check in easy and security quiet. Super breakfast in Concorde Room. Flight then delayed for 2 hours whilst all on board but crew were great. Food and wine superb and service was BA at it's very best.
1792,S Tsoy (Russian Federation) 8th June 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-ARN. All the procedures at Heathrow terminal 5 were a breeze. There was some kind of baggage delivery failure at check-in but the staff managed it very well smiling and being professional. The flight went on an old dirty and worn out A319 though seats were comfortable. The service was of typical intra European flight: light cold snacks and drinks flight attendants were professional. Overall I would use BA in the future but I would prefer flying a newer plane next time.
1793,Derek Salter (South Africa) 8th June 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,LGW to AMS. Easy check-in at Gatwick with the pods to check in and print boarding pass. Did that the night before as staying at an airport hotel. Easy and quick to drop off bag. Departure lounge easy to find. Controlled boarding. Pleasant staff and light snack on short flight. Well recommended and far better to use than T5 at LHR if you have the choice. Luggage took a long time to arrive at AMS but that is Schipol's issue rather than BA.
1794,Mark Murphy (United Kingdom) 8th June 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,I really do not have the energy to write very detail of how bad my very recent flight too (and from) Vegas was with BA however I can categorically state I will never fly with them again and am bewildered as to how they survive a superior option as an airline. Highlights of my journey include: Severe overheating on flight complaints ignored until someone fainted. Delayed on runway for 90 minutes for what was described as catering reasons. Running out of food and beverage 1 hr into a 11 hour flight. (No beer 1 hr in to flight - after the 90 minute delay). Uninterested and incompetent staff. Lost luggage. (1 case has so far turned up). Space reduced to less than a foot (Head to back of seat) once person in front inevitably reclines. I could honestly go on and on about how bad an experience this flight was and am being completely honest when I say that I am an easy customer to please. If you have Virgin as an option even its a bit more expensive please take my word for it and go with them they are a class apart. BA operate as a (poor) budget airline posing as something else. Very poor journey shocking experience.
1795,Charlie Harm (United Kingdom) 8th June 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,Flew in Club World for the first time on the new BA A380s. Big disappointment. The two upper deck cabins feel congested with more seats than the upper deck of a 747 yet noticeably fewer staff per passenger and too few toilets. The dinner service on the LHR-JNB flight was chronically slow (about three hours from beginning to end). The staff have been instructed to deliver drinks by hand from the galleys (rather than from a trolley) and to plate all the meals. All this takes too long with this level of staffing and the passenger experience suffers. The cabin crew were also curiously bad tempered perhaps due to the frustration of trying to deliver an over complicated meal service to increasingly disgruntled passengers. A pity as the planes are quieter than previous generation aircraft and the flight was very smooth.
1796,A Ward (United Kingdom) 5th June 2014,4/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-ATH-ATH June 2014. Both flights 1.5 hours late which always seems to be the case largely due to the old plane (767) used on this particular flight. Food average cabin crew variable-average overall. No apologies for lateness of flights which unacceptable-BA still seem to think that they are doing you a favour for letting you fly with them. Poor overall and am even considering using Easyjet as Gatwick closer to my home.
1797,Barry Hebblethwaite (United Kingdom) 4th June 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LHR to BKK in club world over night flight. Lounge at T5 great. Nice choice of hot foods wines and snacks. Love the spa treatments. I really like the club world seats very private for sleeping. Food tasty had mushroom pasta. Good choice of films. Most of crew in club did a great job still get the odd one here and there that are surly and disinterested - make you feel as if they are doing you a favour! I always try and fly BA on the whole a great airline.
1798,G Bennett (United Kingdom) 4th June 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,Sao Paulo - London Heathrow Club World. Sat in the upper deck on the 747. Fantastic experience. Very comfortable flight with attentive helpful cabin crew. Reasonable food good selection of drinks and good IFE.
1799,Linda Bowen (Barbados) 4th June 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled from Barbados to London Gatwick and then onwards to Italy using British Airways in both instances. Returned to Gatwick on May 28 and again travelled by BA to Barbados. My experience in all instances was extremely positive. The flight crew on all flights accommodated my every request. The food was served at the right temperature at appropriate intervals and was tasty. I would definitely use this airline again.
1800,N Oakshott (United Kingdom) 1st June 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,A long time user of BA I have seen a gradual decline in quality now hit freefall and the LHR-PHX-LHR route that I use monthly has become more akin to sitting in a cattle truck than a B747. Old airframes with tatty interiors are the norm legroom is extremely limited the aircraft is seldom what you would call clean and the crews give the impression they are almost putting themselves out to serve you. Food is not worthy of the name and the whole experience is an utterly miserable 10 hours of your life each leg. Enough is enough and 1st June is the last time I'll use the outbound flight as I'm switching across to United via ORD in future. OK it means a changeover in Chicago but the recent experience was a refreshing change from BA and I actually felt like I was wanted on the United flights.
1801,James Little (United Kingdom) 1st June 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-Warsaw. Economy on an A320. Plane seemed brand new. Was seated in 8C towards the front of Economy and that's obviously a seat that gets configured for Club Europe from time to time as the seat pitch was pretty generous. Complimentary breakfast consisting of coffee and a filled croissant was perfectly OK. Service efficient. Flight left and landed on time. Textbook stuff really. No complaints at all.
1802,M Lucas (United Kingdom) 29th May 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,"Boeing 767 Club Europe to Istanbul and back. The seats were tatty and very worn leg room limited at best thankfully the passenger in front on both legs did not recline their seats. The head rests are hanging off as are parts of the cabin. The food was ok but turning out a ""plastic pot"" upside down into the china bowl in front of you isn't that great. Even though I know they do that in the galley in first class it doesn't need to be on display. Crew much better inbound."
1803,Murat Nal (United Kingdom) 28th May 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,Gatwick-Tampa. Check in simple lounge at Gatwick average aircraft B777. Clean and departed on time. On board pleasant welcome food just about ok after some research chose seat 4K window you won't disturb anyone getting out. But have to agree with mostly everyone else that seats are small and facing a stranger is quite odd. Cabin crew excellent flight crew informative through out the flight which landed on time. Anyone booking Business as opposed to Eco or Eco plus should know that all you are really paying extra for is a cramped flat seat and allowance of 3x32kg bag checked in instead of 2x23kg in Eco. Good films to choose from but music naff as is the screen. Brought my own in ear Bose IQ20 headset Excellent for flights.
1804,Amanda Hutchinson (United Kingdom) 28th May 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,My husband and I travelled to San Diego from Heathrow and back via JFK five weeks later. Service is appalling. Stewards are slightly more pleasant than the stewardesses who are particularly rude abrupt and lazy. Food is particularly foul and there was a long period of some hours (the flight to San Diego is 12 hours) without access to water or beverages. Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me. Dinner was pretty awful and the next meal: breakfast comprised of a near frozen croissant. The problem is staff. There needs to be a senior manager travelling on these routes in 'cattle class' incognito - then they will understand what it is like to be treated with complete disdain.
1805,Faye Edmundson (Canada) 27th May 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,I flew on Apr 29 to Belfast changing in Heathrow and also May 6th from Belfast to (via Heathrow) Barcelona then May 17 from Venice - Heathrow) then to Vancouver BC. I was very pleased with the service and meals and flight attendants were great. The only part was that changing at Heathrow was a bit of a pain having to wait to see on the board re what gate to go to but otherwise everything was great.
1806,M Wilson (United Kingdom) 27th May 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,I found BA to be the worst airline I have used. Flew LHR to Boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. Cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. Also leg room appalling with trim falling of the seat in front of me. It had the interior of an old knackered plane. I have flown Singapore Airlines who run rings around this bunch. I could have flown with Virgin instead for the same money and would have had a vastly superior less drab experience.
1807,S Arangelov (Bulgaria) 27th May 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,"Heathrow - Johannesburg A380. My first flight on A380. After half an hour delay because of planes late arrival boarding started. First thing I noticed was how tiny the seats were. Second thing to notice is that the plane was not properly cleaned. There were grease stains and empty cans left behind. At this point I noticed some toilet paper between the panels above my head. When asked the cabin crew explained this is how they fixed condensation problem from the air conditioning. Anyhow time for lift off. I turned on the inflight entertainment system to watch it from the camera at the tail of the plane. After looking for 5 minutes I couldn't find it anywhere. (Later I found out there is no such option on BA A380s). So no tail cam fine let's listen to some music. Wrong the headphones are not working. Cabin crew assures me they will ""bring me some more"". One hour later suffice it to say cabin crew did not bring anything. I've managed to grab a pair of unused headphones from one empty seat just to find out they were not working either. Probably it was some problem with the jack in the seat rendering the whole inflight entertainment system pointless. And if that was not enough it was time for dinner. By the time it was my turn BA had run out of ""chicken"" so my dinner was asparagus with rice or something like that. You don't even have to look at it to understand why everyone else was choosing the ""chicken"". So no edible dinner and soundless entertainment system. Pretty much spent the rest of the journey counting the minutes until I could get off this plane. The worst part is I have a return trip with BA which I'll be looking to switch to another airline if possible."
1808,D Chamberlain (United Kingdom) 26th May 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,Club Europe London Heathrow T3 to Lisbon. T3 lounge very good. Boarding fine and helpful but it is disappointing that this flight consistently requires a bus to link the terminal to the plane and that there is no specific service for Club Europe passengers. There is little point in fast tracking us at other stages of the journey to ignore us at this point. Good flight excellent cabin crew - why can't BA have a consistency of cabin crew quality? Today's crew were excellent - attentive engaged appropriately friendly and amusing and consistent with their service throughput the flight. Food was fine champagne improved from previous flights. Quality of cabin still modest - upgrade of the cabins really should be a priority but I fear that BA's focus is on the long haul not those of us who travel within Europe. Efficient upon arriving at Lisbon.
1809,H Stewart (United Kingdom) 26th May 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Heathrow - Johannesburg. Concorde lounge comfortable as always. A little underwhelmed at first by first class on the A380 not as spacious or appealing as I had expected. However it had all that I needed including a very good screen for the IFE. Had the 5-course taster menu but different wines than those which were suggested. Was very good indeed did not have the dessert but the better half pronounced it outstanding. Unfortunately arrived at same time as several other long-haul flights so immigration was a pain but not much BA can do about that.
1810,C Tyler (United Kingdom) 18th May 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,When we booked our holiday to Barbados I was really pleased to see we were flying with British Airways as they have a good reputation. Sadly our experiences put a lie to this. As part of the service they offer BA allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. I tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. After a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator (whose grasp of English wasn't great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than “keep trying”. I rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other than a better grasp of English was still unable to assist in any way. Both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the Airport. So in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. We entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on the same row. By now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! We then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually we're allocated 2 seats together. As they were free I don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? I have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. Sadly British Airways don't appear to follow this doctrine. The legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat I had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. As my TV screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. I managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so I was forced to stop. I would love to see what regulations BA have to follow regarding VDU viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. The final disappointment came when the food was distributed. I had the Thai Chicken which was over-cooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. She didn't eat hers. I ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. All in all this was an experience I do not want to repeat and I shall certainly not fly British Airways by choice in the future! We didn't have these problems with Sri Lanka Airlines.
1811,R Richards (United Kingdom) 18th May 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-Antigua on 29 April and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It started off badly when I went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 February. The system rejected both my credit and debit cards. On checking the state of my account with BA online I found that the final payment had been credited to my account and I now owed the initial deposit. I sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. First call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of English. Another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. I was told it had been sorted out and received E ticket email with my state of account showing I owed nothing. Two weeks later I received another E ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. Next credit card statement did not show money taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. Two weeks before flight I got a phone call from BA stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. I then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. About 22 hours before flight I went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. Arrived at LGW to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ‘bring back the old system. We then had to queue to drop off baggage. Other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. Flight left and arrived on time. However the inflight main meal was the worst I have ever experienced on an aircraft. There was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. The inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to Singapore in 1962 was better. On return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. Check in at Antigua was one of the quickest check ins I have ever done. Left Antigua on time and arrived LGW on time. Food was worse than going out. No choice. Starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. Main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. White wine was just about drinkable. Coffee served as we started main course. Asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty. At least with Ryanair you know what you get for your money.
1812,D Ellis (United Kingdom) 18th May 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-JTR-LHR. A tale of opposites for BA's new route to Santorini. Outward it couldn't have been better with excellent FAs decent food and arrival that was ahead of schedule. The return started off poorly with substandard facilities at Santorini airport including no online check-in no business class lounge and no priority boarding. An air traffic controller issue kept the plane grounded for 30 minutes. On board they'd forgotten the menus for the dinner service and the starter and cheese course had been left behind. The Club Europe toilet then ran out of water. So overall okay but the return was disappointing.
1813,Steve Adolfo (United Kingdom) 17th May 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,Travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 young children) from London to Boston I hoped there wouldn't be a problem sitting together in the 4 middle seats. I had not paid to reserve my seat as I had never had to pay extra before while flying with Emirates Singapore or Cathay Pacific. The seats allocated at check in were 3 on the left (A/B/C). My wife sat with the kids while I had to sit in the row behind. The seats could not be changed at check in or on the plane. It seemed ridiculous that we were not allocated the logical place for a family of 4 in the middle of the plane even though my flight had been booked 5 months in advance. I warned the stewardess that the situation would be difficult for my family for the staff and the passengers around as this proved when my 3 year old cried as he wanted to sit next to me. I had to swap seats with my wife a couple of times during the flight it was a stressful flight. On the return flight I reluctantly paid extra (£23 x 4) to make sure we got the 4 middle seats. The journey was less stressful but my wife had her own issues as she couldn't recline as the passenger behind was too tall and refused to move his legs (he should have paid and extra £23 and reserved a seat with more leg room). My wife complained to the steward as the passenger refused to let my wife recline he was made to move to a different seat. In conclusion I found staff were generally friendly but didn't exert themselves on service the food was okay but the entertainment system was dated it didn't have any games and the screen kept freezing. It seems the flight services to USA are not up to the same standard as flying to the Middle East or the Far East as British Airways had failed in comparison at all levels when compared with the other airlines mentioned earlier - my last experience to the USA was with American Airlines and that was worse than BA. The main disappointing issue with BA is definitely having to pay extra for choosing your seat. If you are travelling with a family of 4 and you want to guarantee you sit together you have to pay an extra £200 on top of the original cost of the return ticket this felt more like the additional charges of Ryanair!
1814,David Worcester (United Kingdom) 15th May 2014,3/10,British Airways customer review,LCY-SNN-JFK-LCY BA001 and 004. Quick check in and fast track security although I had to show my boarding pass to get expedited. Gate 24 lounge with a view of our aircraft and a glass of champagne. Quick boarding nice welcome by a familiar face. Cabin has stood up well and is as fresh as it was on introduction. Starter choice to Shannon now replaced by a selection of canapes served on a plate. USA immigration straight forward and soon back on the aircraft but the airport is soulless. Once in the air salad drinks and a choice of mains. I had the curry which was excellent followed by chocolate fondant smothered in chocloate sauce - bliss. Later on the Friday 001 flight which departs at 1245 as opposed to 0945 they serve supper rather than afternoon tea. This was a plate of cold cuts and samosas.Tasty.Quick disembarkation lovely crew. Return on 004 Sunday evening supper in the busy Galleries dining room. then quick boarding on this full 31/32 flight. Supper served to those who wanted it and then a full hot English breakfast option or a bag to go. Bussed to the arrivals hall and immigration and then home in 15 minutes. Excellent crew and flight.
1815,D Leston (United Kingdom) 15th May 2014,9/10,British Airways customer review,MIA-LHR in World Traveller on a 747-400. After having flown 3 consecutive legs on AA (and having been pleasantly surprised) I wasn't sure how an old BA 747 would measure up but aircraft was spotless and in full working order. Crew were friendly and helpful. The food was pretty good and the IFE far better than AA.
1816,R Vincent (United Kingdom) 15th May 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,Flew to Vegas on 8th May and dismayed at the standard. Filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. Only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. Sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative; we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did (around row 31) as it normally happened. The worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.
1817,Marlene Miller (United States) 13th May 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,On a recent vacation from Sacramento to Paris some friends and I had a terrible experience with another airline and had some trepidation about our return flight from Paris to Sacramento. We did however choose British Airways for the return flight and none of us had flown with them before. I am happy to report that the experience was totally different. Our flight was delayed by an hour which did effect our layover and did rush us to our next flight but we had a cushion of 2 hours layover so we were ok. On the flight the seats were more comfortable more leg room less noisy better entertainment due to screens on seats in front of you and the access to the bathroom was much easier to navigate. We also had seats relatively together which the other airline refused to offer us even though we had made the reservation months in advance. Their screen was so far ahead I couldn't see it and it offered only one choice. The staff was very kind to hydrate us frequently and gave us plenty to eat and it was all very palatable. I will definitely recommend British Airways for International flights to my friends.
1818,Kathleen Osborne (United Kingdom) 12th May 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,I should be in a nice hotel in Romania instead 9 hours after I arrived in Heathrow courtesy of British Airways I am still in Heathrow heading back to Glasgow! The 7am flight went well 10/10 for getting me from Glasgow to London. The connecting flight to Bucharest was delayed by more than an hour which meant I wouldn't get my connecting flight to Timisoara. I duly went to customer services (waited 50 mins) who offered to get me to Timisoara tomorrow about 3pm as the last flight on 9/5/14 was fully booked. They offered to put me up in a hotel in Bucharest but were not able to book one. Having waited 50 mins at a BA desk where apparently there was nothing they could do to check availability of a hotel in Bucharest I was not filled with confidence. Since I was going out for only 48 hours and would miss a large part of my meeting I decided to go back to Glasgow. I was booked on the 15.50 to Glasgow and given a slip of paper with all the details and told to go to the gate when it was called as they would know all about the booking as it was on the computer. Told my boarding pass was sorted. They hadn't sorted it and I got a lecture about what I needed to do in future. There was no way I was getting on the flight told that I should be grateful as they were doing me a favour putting me on the 6.50pm flight. Told to go back to the service desk and wait in the queue again!
1819,L Matt (United Kingdom) 11th May 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-FRA-LCY May 2014. LHR-FRA on a 767 row 18. Checked-in via the mobile app no bags to drop as a day trip. BA Galleries South for a quick spot of breakfast. Boarding started 20 minutes before departure. Not a full flight. Left slightly late due to cargo being loaded but arrived on time. Standard seating and food for BA short haul European flight. Return FRA-LCY on a E70 Row 15. Use of the JAL lounge at FRA opposite the gate area. Bus to the aircraft and an on-time departure. Full flight and not much room up above for carry on items on this aircraft on a full flight. Legroom quite tight in row 15. Again standard food and drink for a BA short haul service.
1820,Tanmay Bhakta (Australia) 8th May 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,I flew Singapore to Sydney with them recently and it was the most horrible flying experience. At the boarding gate the staff were just so disorganised in getting the passengers on board that we had to wait for almost an hour before we got on. The plane was an old and tired 747-400 which had the dirtiest cabin I have seen. There was a stale smell lingering in the premium economy cabin. The seats were old worn out and lumpy despite being in premium economy. The inflight entertainment was a joke. The video quality was mediocre and the noise cancelling headphones were not working for most of the flight. The food was some strange fried rice which was bland. The crew were unfriendly they didn't serve drinks once throughout the flight. The worst part were the toilets smelly with a toilet bowl and sink choked with toilet paper. Overall I will never fly British Airways again unless I don't have any choice.
1821,A Amaladoss (United Kingdom) 7th May 2014,2/10,British Airways customer review,LGW-VRN-LGW both in Club Europe. Was offered an upgrade on the way out for £85. Swift check-in as Gatwick was quiet at 6.30am. Used the Galleries lounge-reasonable cold food selection but the only hot option was porridge. Nice atmosphere though and good views of the runway. Left slightly late due to congestion. Nice breakfast with individual bottles of Heidseck Monopole champagne. No aerobridges at Verona so had to walk to a bus in the rain. Bags delivered quickly. Return flight was delayed by an hour as the incoming flight was late. BA use the Catullo lounge which is very poor with an abysmal selection of food-nothing hot not even a sandwich just biscuits and pastries at 9pm! The lounge is before the security check so not able to relax altogether. Crew very apologetic about delay speedy drinks and meal service-the chicken curry was passable.
1822,Alan Clare (United Kingdom) 7th May 2014,7/10,British Airways customer review,6 May 2014: Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777. Back on BA again thanks to Avios Companion coupon. Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. I've flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content. Yesterdays offering for Breakfast was almost an insult.
1823,A Amaladoss (United Kingdom) 7th May 2014,5/10,British Airways customer review,LHR-YYZ in business was looking forward to a B787 but this flight was a B777. Had the rear facing seat- comfortable enough but it is always awkward trying to clamber over the passenger seated diagonally opposite. Enjoyed the plentiful supply of pink champagne. Lunch was fine as was the afternoon tea. IFE screen on the small side but managed one movie. Crew were pleasant friendly and efficient.
1824,P Harris (United Kingdom) 7th May 2014,8/10,British Airways customer review,"Lanzarote to Gatwick on 13th April. Flight itself was okay but on arrival we were ""parked"" a long way from the baggage reclaim area (for which the Captain apologised). After a 30 minute walk from the plane our problems began as we then waited another more than 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. Many flights that landed a long time after us received our bags and set off home far more promptly. BA have acknowledged they are responsible for the journey from ""start to finish"" but have gone on to advise that some parts of the operation are sub contracted including this part. Can't recommend BA because of this experience and because of the way our subsequent complaint has been handled. Not planning to use BA again because of this."
1825,C Thomas (United Kingdom) 6th May 2014,1/10,British Airways customer review,"I'm not normally one to whine but here goes. LHR-CDG at 0725 on a Tuesday morning via the dreaded gate A10. Plenty of ""Fast Track"" signage and we fast trackers were herded through the checkpoint onto a bus where we waited until we were joined by all the other passengers! Outstanding! Flight OK (fairly grubby ex BD A320) but the pointlessness of a non fast Fast Track amused me no end."
1826,Berry Nick (United Kingdom) 6th May 2014,6/10,British Airways customer review,JFK to LHR. Empty check in and priority security quick. New food selection in First class lounge but preferred the decent meal in the dining room. Boarding easy and upper deck crew excellent as lights not turned on until just before descent with arrival on time. Bus to terminal but bags waiting when we got there.

1828,A Hickling (United Kingdom) 4th May 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,Travelled to HKG on board the new A380. Boarding was efficient with a dedicated air bridge for First passengers. Welcomed on board offered champagne newspaper pyjamas and wash bag and settled into my suite. The space is more noticeable than a 747 or 777 equivalent with a wardrobe that can fit carry on baggage a jacket and shoes plus a side bin that accommodates other items. The food was excellent with the choice of a five course taster menu with accompanying wines or a la carte. There are also treats available in the first galley. Breakfast was also very good. I managed to get plenty of sleep as the aircraft is very quiet and walked around the entire plane to get a sense of scale. The crew were excellent addressed me by name engaged in conversation whilst delivering an unobtrusive service. The entertainment system was the Thales product. Plenty of choice interactive screens and no rebooting as is the case on other long haul aircraft. I couldn't fault this flight just a pity I couldn't spend longer on it. Looking forward to the return journey.
1829,Iain Henderson (United Kingdom) 3rd May 2014,10/10,British Airways customer review,"BA 059 London to Cape Town April 29 2014 economy. It's been a while since I flew BA world traveller and it will be even longer until I use them again. Clapped out 747 terrible uncomfortable seats awful back of seat video system. - my partners failed. The crew seemed totally disinterested and disengaged and far more interested in getting the ""service"" note the quotes over with ASAP. all they wanted to do was to retreat behind the curtain and gossip. Perfunctory drinks service - when asking for a whisky and soda I was offered whisky and tonic. Paper cups for coffee at breakfast. Meals are better at a Little Chef. The amenity kit was an ancient set of headphones and a toothbrush. Never again. Wake up BA there are major competitors out there and next time it Emirates via Dubai."
